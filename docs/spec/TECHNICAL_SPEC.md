# color-d — Technical Specification

**Status:** Draft / Research-derived specification  
**Project:** `color-d`  
**Language:** D  
**Primary consumers:** OSM/geospatial editor, `imagery-d`  
**Scope:** Color mathematics, conversion, compositing, perceptual operations and palette primitives

---

## 1. Purpose

`color-d` is a small, type-safe, allocation-free color mathematics library for D.

Its central design principle is:

> A color value always belongs to a known color space, and operations that change color-space semantics are explicit.

The library provides mathematical building blocks for applications that need correct color representation, conversion, interpolation, compositing, contrast analysis and perceptual manipulation.

Primary initial consumers are:

- the planned D OSM/geospatial editor;
- `imagery-d`;
- GUI and rendering code built on top of those projects.

The library itself remains independent of:

- OSM;
- GUI frameworks;
- image formats;
- rendering APIs;
- OpenGL, Vulkan or WebGPU;
- application-specific theme semantics.

---

# 2. Design goals

`color-d` shall provide:

- explicit, statically typed color spaces;
- a strict distinction between encoded sRGB and linear-light sRGB;
- compact value types suitable for hot paths;
- generic `float` and `double` computation;
- packed 8-bit storage types;
- modern perceptual color spaces centered around Oklab and OKLCH;
- correct linear-light alpha compositing;
- explicit gamut testing, clipping and gamut mapping;
- explicit interpolation semantics;
- relative luminance and contrast computation;
- palette and tone-scale primitives;
- compile-time evaluation where technically possible;
- predictable data layout suitable for interoperability;
- `@safe`, `pure`, `nothrow` and `@nogc` mathematical operations wherever applicable.

The public API should be small, orthogonal and difficult to misuse.

---

# 3. Non-goals

`color-d` is not an image-processing library.

The core library will not implement:

- resizing;
- convolution;
- blur;
- image codecs;
- raster tiling;
- image caching;
- image I/O.

Those belong in `imagery-d` or other consumers.

The initial library will also not attempt to become a full color-management system.

Out of scope for v0.1:

- ICC profile processing;
- CMYK production workflows;
- printer/device profiling;
- rendering intents;
- prepress;
- HDR pipelines;
- complex display calibration;
- CSS parsing and serialization;
- application-specific GUI themes.

---

# 4. Architectural principles

## 4.1 Color space is part of the type

The library shall not represent mathematical colors as anonymous component arrays such as:

```d
float[3]
```

for public APIs.

Instead:

```d
SRgb!float
LinearSRgb!float
XyzD65!float
Oklab!float
Oklch!float
Hsl!float
Hsv!float
```

This prevents semantically incompatible values from being accidentally mixed.

For example:

```d
SRgbf encoded;
LinearSRgbf linear;
```

must be distinct types despite having the same physical component layout.

---

## 4.2 Color-space conversion is explicit

Implicit conversions between different color spaces are prohibited.

Preferred API:

```d
auto linear = rgb.toLinear;
auto lab    = rgb.toOklab;
auto lch    = lab.toOklch;
```

Conversions shall not normally be exposed as implicit constructors or generic `opCast` operations.

The source code should visibly show when color semantics change.

---

## 4.3 Storage and computation are different concerns

Packed storage and mathematical computation are distinct concerns.

If bounded packed color-value types such as future `SRgb8` / `SRgba8` are
promoted later, they remain distinct from mathematical working types such as:

```d
SRgb!float
LinearSRgb!float
Oklab!float
```

Potential packed storage types are intended for use cases such as:

- UI interoperability;
- textures;
- compact tables;
- renderer upload.

Image-file and pixel-layout ownership remains with the image/raster layer as
defined by the `imagery-d` boundary.

Computational types use floating-point values and may temporarily contain values outside the nominal display gamut.

R0.14 deliberately defers concrete packed color-value types from v0.1 until a
consumer justifies and validates their quantization/storage contract.

---


## 4.4 Boundary with imagery-d

`color-d` owns colour-value semantics and general colour mathematics.
`imagery-d` owns image-channel binding, pixel/layout semantics, image colour
metadata, alpha-channel identity, masks/validity/NoData, raster-region
execution and metadata preservation.

Packed values such as `SRgb8` / `SRgba8` do not define an image pixel format
or channel-binding rule. An image consumer must establish colour-component
binding explicitly before materializing a `color-d` value.

The accepted reciprocal contract is documented in:

`docs/research/IMAGERY_D_BOUNDARY.md`.

`imagery-d -> color-d` is permitted when a concrete image operation needs a
promoted production capability; `color-d` must remain independent of
`imagery-d` and `raster-d`.

# 5. Scalar model

Computational color types in the accepted v0.1 core are generic over:

```text
float
double
```

The promoted computational value types are:

```d
struct SRgb(T);
struct LinearSRgb(T);
struct XyzD65(T);
struct Oklab(T);
struct Oklch(T);
```

with constraints rejecting unsupported scalar types.

`real` is not part of the initial scalar contract. The public numerical and
performance contract should not depend on platform-specific extended precision.

Convenience aliases should be provided for both accepted scalar widths:

```d
alias SRgbf        = SRgb!float;
alias SRgbd        = SRgb!double;
alias LinearSRgbf  = LinearSRgb!float;
alias LinearSRgbd  = LinearSRgb!double;
alias XyzD65f      = XyzD65!float;
alias XyzD65d      = XyzD65!double;
alias Oklabf       = Oklab!float;
alias Oklabd       = Oklab!double;
alias Oklchf       = Oklch!float;
alias Oklchd       = Oklch!double;
```

Expected use:

- `float` for normal rendering, GUI and large arrays;
- `double` for high-precision computation, validation and reference tests.

Integer color representations remain separate explicit storage types.

---

# 6. Initial public color spaces

## 6.1 Required for v0.1

### Encoded sRGB

```d
SRgb!T
```

Represents standard nonlinear sRGB encoding.

The earlier packed candidates `SRgb8` and `SRgba8` are deliberately deferred
from v0.1. Their ownership remains with `color-d` if later promoted, but R0 did
not validate the quantization/storage contract and no first consumer currently
requires them.

---

### Linear-light sRGB

```d
LinearSRgb!T
```

This is the primary space for:

- physical RGB arithmetic;
- alpha compositing;
- luminance;
- selected interpolation operations.

It must never be interchangeable with encoded sRGB.

---

### XYZ D65

```d
XyzD65!T
```

XYZ D65 is public rather than merely an internal conversion node.

It provides a stable bridge for:

- sRGB;
- future Display-P3;
- future Rec.2020;
- Oklab;
- scientific consumers;
- standards/reference tests.

---

### Oklab

```d
Oklab!T
```

Oklab is the primary rectangular perceptual color space.

Primary uses:

- perceptual interpolation;
- color-distance calculations;
- theme generation;
- UI color manipulation.

---

### OKLCH

```d
Oklch!T
```

OKLCH is the primary polar perceptual color space.

Primary uses:

- tone scales;
- shades;
- hue-preserving transformations;
- palette and tone construction primitives;
- gamut mapping.

---

# 7. Deferred color spaces

Not required for the first public implementation:

```text
HSL
HSV / HSB
XYZ D50
CIELAB
CIELCh
Display-P3
linear Display-P3
Rec.2020
Okhsl
Okhsv
HDR-specific spaces
```

HSL and HSV were present in the early v0.1 candidate list for legacy/UI and
color-picker interoperability. They are deliberately deferred because the
executable R0 work did not validate them as part of the modern mathematical
core and no first consumer currently requires them.

Display-P3 is expected to be the first major wide-gamut extension after the initial sRGB-centered core.

CIELAB/LCh remain useful for standards interoperability and historical Delta-E algorithms, but are not required by the initial OSM/GUI consumers.

---

# 8. Range and gamut semantics

Computational color values shall not automatically clamp themselves to displayable component ranges.

For example:

```d
SRgbf(1.12f, -0.04f, 0.70f)
```

is a valid intermediate mathematical value.

This is necessary for:

- loss-minimizing round trips;
- color-space transformations;
- wide-gamut conversion;
- perceptual transformations;
- gamut mapping.

Therefore the following concepts are separate:

```d
inGamut(color)
clip(color)
gamutMap(color)
```

### `inGamut`

Tests whether a color lies inside a target gamut.

It does not modify the value.

### `clip`

Performs explicit hard component clipping.

It is mathematically simple but may alter hue and perceived color.

### `gamutMap`

Performs explicit perceptual gamut mapping.

It must never happen silently as part of `toSRgb()`.

---

# 9. NaN and infinity policy

The mathematical core should not silently normalize or repair invalid floating-point values.

Operations may provide diagnostics such as:

```d
isFinite(color)
isInGamut(color)
```

but NaN and infinity should remain visible to the caller unless an explicitly named operation handles them.

CSS-specific concepts such as missing components expressed through `none` are parser-layer semantics and do not belong in the mathematical core types.

### 9.1 `.init` policy

Promoted computational value types do not redefine `.init` to mean black,
transparent black or another valid color.

The natural floating-point `.init` state remains non-finite and therefore
visibly invalid/uninitialized for semantic use.

Operations that require finite or domain-valid input apply their own explicit
contract instead of treating default initialization as an implicit color
policy.

---

# 10. Conversion API

Expected primitive operations include:

```d
toLinear
toSRgb
toXyzD65
toOklab
toOklch
```

Conversions should be allocation-free.

Whenever practical they should be:

```d
@safe
pure
nothrow
@nogc
```

Round-trip behavior must be specified and tested independently for `float` and `double`.

---

# 11. Alpha model

Alpha is a first-class concern.

Rather than defining a separate alpha-bearing type for every color space, the preferred architecture is an orthogonal wrapper:

```d
Alpha!Color
```

Conceptually:

```d
Alpha!(SRgbf)
Alpha!(LinearSRgbf)
Alpha!(Oklabf)
```

A distinct representation shall be considered for premultiplied alpha:

```d
Premultiplied!Color
```

or an equivalent strongly typed model.

Straight and premultiplied alpha must not be silently interchangeable.

---

# 12. Alpha compositing

Normal source-over compositing shall operate in linear-light RGB.

Typical preferred working type:

```d
Premultiplied!(LinearSRgbf)
```

Core operations may include:

```d
premultiplyAlpha
unpremultiplyAlpha
composite
```

The implementation shall avoid gamma-space compositing.

Application renderers may store other representations, but the library's mathematically correct reference behavior uses linear-light RGB.

---

# 13. Interpolation

The library shall not claim that one interpolation space is universally correct.

Different semantics require different spaces:

- encoded sRGB: compatibility/legacy behavior;
- linear sRGB: physical RGB/light interpolation;
- Oklab: perceptually smooth interpolation;
- OKLCH: hue/chroma-aware interpolation.

The lowest-level primitive should preferably operate on matching types:

```d
interpolate(a, b, t)
```

Example:

```d
auto mixed =
    interpolate(
        a.toOklab,
        b.toOklab,
        0.5
    ).toSRgb;
```

A later convenience API may select the space through an explicit policy.

---

# 14. Polar hue interpolation

Polar color spaces require explicit hue interpolation rules.

Provide a policy equivalent to:

```d
enum HuePath
{
    shorter,
    longer,
    increasing,
    decreasing
}
```

The caller must be able to select the interpolation route when required.

Default behavior may follow the shorter angular path.

---

# 15. Perceptual manipulation

Core operations should remain mathematically explicit.

Preferred primitives:

```d
withLightness
withChroma
withHue
```

For example:

```d
auto brighter = color.toOklch.withLightness(0.82);
```

Generic convenience names such as:

```d
lighten()
darken()
```

should not be added until their semantics are unambiguous and formally documented.

They must not silently mean HSV/HSL manipulation.

---

# 16. Relative luminance and contrast

WCAG-2 relative luminance and general colorimetric XYZ-D65 Y are distinct
operations and must not be silently aliased.

The initial accessibility-oriented measurement is explicitly sRGB-specific and
WCAG-2-specific.

Research naming candidates include:

```d
wcag2RelativeLuminance
wcag2ContrastRatio
```

These names remain provisional until consumer validation.

Generic names such as:

```d
relativeLuminance
contrastRatio
```

should not be frozen while multiple luminance and contrast concepts may coexist.

## 16.1 WCAG-2 relative luminance

WCAG-2 relative luminance uses the published WCAG coefficients:

```text
0.2126
0.7152
0.0722
```

after sRGB transfer decoding.

Encoded sRGB channel values must never be inserted directly into the luminance
formula without decoding.

Within the valid sRGB domain, the already validated color-d sRGB transfer
implementation may be reused.

The WCAG coefficients must not be replaced by the more precise XYZ-D65 matrix
coefficients merely because the resulting values are numerically close.

## 16.2 Valid measurement domain

A standards-facing WCAG-2 measurement requires finite sRGB or linear-sRGB
components in:

```text
0 <= component <= 1
```

Extended color-d values outside this domain remain useful mathematical color
values but are not valid WCAG-2 measurements.

Standards-facing WCAG operations therefore require explicit domain validation.

They must not silently:

- clip;
- gamut-map;
- repair NaN or infinity;
- reinterpret extended color values as valid WCAG input.

Unchecked arithmetic may exist internally where useful, but must not be
presented as a valid standards measurement for invalid-domain input.

## 16.3 Contrast ratio

For valid WCAG-2 relative luminances:

```text
L1 >= L2

contrast = (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)
```

The valid-domain range is:

```text
1 : 1
```

through:

```text
21 : 1
```

Contrast measurement is distinct from accessibility pass/fail policy.

Context-dependent concepts such as:

```text
AA
AAA
large text
normal text
non-text UI
font size
font weight
```

belong in a higher-level accessibility or theme layer.

## 16.4 Alpha

An unresolved alpha color does not have one standalone WCAG contrast ratio.

The actual rendered color must be resolved against its background before
ordinary contrast measurement.

WCAG measurement must not silently infer a background or introduce hidden
compositing policy.

Premultiplied storage must not be interpreted directly as ordinary RGB input
for contrast measurement.

## 16.5 Invalid-result representation

R0.9 compared several checked-result representations.

A two-field result:

```d
struct Measurement(T)
{
    T value;
    bool valid;
}
```

is not the preferred candidate because DMD 2.111 showed a large,
reproducible `double` code-generation regression for this representation.

A compact single-scalar measurement is the preferred research candidate:

```text
finite scalar -> valid measurement
NaN           -> invalid measurement
```

with validity derived from the scalar state.

This preserves value semantics and keeps the representation at:

```text
float  -> 4 bytes
double -> 8 bytes
```

A future production type must control construction so callers cannot create
arbitrary supposedly valid measurements outside the defined result domain.

A `try(..., ref T)` form remains a valid alternative if later consumer
evidence favors it.

No result representation is frozen during R0.

## 16.6 Performance and compiler evidence

R0.9 found that the compact scalar result and `try(..., ref T)` have similar
encoded-sRGB and contrast performance on the measured system.

DMD 2.111 showed a large regression specifically for the two-field
`{ double, bool }` result representation. DMD 2.113 removed most of that
specific result-shape regression, so the 2.111 behavior is not a durable ABI
rule and must not drive a permanent public representation choice.

The later release-gate investigation isolated a separate and much larger
transfer-function bottleneck. On the tested x86-64 toolchain,
floating/floating `std.math.pow` in both DMD 2.113 and LDC 1.43 routes through
Phobos `_powImpl(real, real)`. Under LDC this executes the general extended-
precision/x87 implementation and made the encoded sRGB/WCAG paths roughly four
times slower than equivalent optimized C++ using the same formulas.

Replacing only that power operation with the native `float`/`double`
runtime path removed the gap. A five-run interleaved comparison measured the
LDC runtime-`llvm_pow` path within approximately 0.999x--1.057x of Clang for
the encoded sRGB operations and approximately 1.027x--1.044x for the measured
contrast operations. This is sufficient evidence that the color-d algorithm
itself can be C++-competitive without `-ffast-math`.

For the sRGB decode domain tested here, LDC `llvm_pow` and direct libm were
bit-identical over 1,000,000 deterministic extended-range `double` samples
and 1,000,000 `float` samples. Relative to the current Phobos path, the
maximum observed finite difference was 1 ULP, with no NaN/Inf classification
mismatches. Explicit tests also preserved the tested signed-zero, transfer-
boundary, infinity and NaN bit patterns.

A portable internal wrapper was validated with this shape:

```d
T colorPow24(T)(T base)
@safe pure nothrow @nogc
{
    if (__ctfe)
        return cast(T)pow(base, cast(T)2.4);

    version (LDC)
    {
        import ldc.intrinsics : llvm_pow;
        return llvm_pow!T(base, cast(T)2.4);
    }
    else
    {
        return cast(T)pow(base, cast(T)2.4);
    }
}
```

Both DMD 2.113 and LDC 1.43 compile and execute this form, including CTFE.
Generated-code inspection confirms that the LDC runtime branch lowers to native
`pow`/`powf`, while DMD continues through the Phobos `_powImpl` path.

DMD remains materially slower even after using its best measured release flags
(`-O -inline -release -boundscheck=off -mcpu=native`) and a direct-libm
probe. In the best-known comparison it remained approximately 1.28x--1.56x
slower than LDC/Clang on encoded operations and approximately 1.51x--1.58x
slower on the measured contrast operations; the pow-free linear controls were
roughly 5x--8x slower.

Therefore v0.1 uses the following compiler-performance policy:

- LDC is the release-performance reference compiler.
- Release-critical hot paths shall be checked against equivalent optimized C++
  implementations using the same algorithm, scalar type, semantics, input set
  and machine.
- Material unexplained LDC-vs-C++ gaps are release concerns.
- DMD remains a supported correctness and portability compiler, but is not
  required to satisfy the same performance gate when reproduced evidence
  isolates the remaining gap to compiler/code-generation behavior.
- Compiler-specific internal optimization paths are permitted when they preserve
  the public API and are separately justified by numerical, CTFE, attribute and
  generated-code evidence.
- `-ffast-math` or equivalent semantic weakening is not part of the default
  performance gate.

These are compiler/version-specific measurements, not universal cross-platform
guarantees. Targeted retesting remains required when compiler changes are
likely to affect a validated hot path.

## 16.7 Future contrast metrics

WCAG 3 / APCA-style contrast models remain separate future research.

They must use explicit separate semantics and must not silently redefine the
meaning of a WCAG-2 operation.

---

# 17. Color difference

Color-d treats color-difference algorithms as explicitly named mathematical
operations.

The API should avoid a generic ambiguous:

```d
deltaE()
```

when multiple algorithms exist.

Preferred explicit names include:

```d
deltaEOK
deltaEOK2
deltaE76
deltaE2000
```

For the initial version only `deltaEOK` is required.

## 17.1 deltaEOK semantics

R0.10 validates `deltaEOK` as ordinary Euclidean distance in Oklab Cartesian
coordinates.

The candidate operation has the shape:

```d
T deltaEOK(T)(Oklab!T lhs, Oklab!T rhs)
if (isColorScalar!T);
```

The two operands use the same scalar type.

The operation is naturally UFCS-capable and should support:

```text
@safe
pure
nothrow
@nogc
CTFE
```

No implicit conversion from another color space belongs inside `deltaEOK`.

A caller starting from sRGB, linear sRGB, XYZ D65 or OKLCH must perform the
required conversion explicitly.

`deltaEOK` does not convert through OKLCH.

## 17.2 Range semantics

Finite extended Oklab coordinates are valid mathematical inputs.

`deltaEOK` must not implicitly:

- clip;
- gamut-map;
- normalize coordinates to a display gamut;
- reject finite values merely because they are outside a nominal display
  domain.

This follows the general color-d rule that mathematically meaningful extended
intermediate values remain visible to the caller.

## 17.3 Numerical implementation

R0.10 rejects the straightforward implementation:

```text
sqrt(dL*dL + da*da + db*db)
```

as the preferred production implementation.

The tested DMD/LDC debug/release matrix demonstrated that intermediate
squaring can overflow or underflow for finite component differences even when
the final Euclidean norm remains representable. The observed behavior also
depends on compiler/build optimization.

Raw three-argument Phobos `hypot` is robust for the tested finite range, but
its observed simple NaN/infinity behavior does not match the required
color-d semantics.

The preferred R1 implementation direction is therefore:

1. compute the three Oklab component differences;
2. explicitly handle NaN;
3. explicitly handle infinity;
4. delegate the fully finite three-dimensional norm to Phobos `hypot`.

Conceptually:

```d
const T dL = lhs.l - rhs.l;
const T da = lhs.a - rhs.a;
const T db = lhs.b - rhs.b;

if (isNaN(dL) || isNaN(da) || isNaN(db))
    return T.nan;

if (fabs(dL) == T.infinity ||
    fabs(da) == T.infinity ||
    fabs(db) == T.infinity)
{
    return T.infinity;
}

return hypot(dL, da, db);
```

A custom scaled three-dimensional norm was also validated and remains a
fallback/reference implementation, but it is not preferred while guarded
Phobos `hypot` satisfies the requirements.

## 17.4 Non-finite semantics

`deltaEOK` makes its special-value behavior explicit rather than inheriting it
accidentally from a compiler or standard-library implementation.

The validated ordering is:

```text
any NaN component difference
    -> NaN

otherwise any infinite component difference
    -> +Inf

otherwise
    -> finite Euclidean norm
```

NaN therefore takes precedence if NaN and infinity occur together.

No checked-result wrapper is currently justified for `deltaEOK`.

## 17.5 Alpha boundary

`deltaEOK` measures Oklab coordinates, not unresolved alpha-bearing colors.

`Alpha!(Oklab!T)` and premultiplied color representations are not direct input
to the primitive.

If rendered appearance is to be compared, alpha/background resolution must
occur explicitly before color-difference measurement.

`deltaEOK` must not infer or silently composite against a background.

## 17.6 JND and classification policy

A color-difference value is a measurement, not a perceptibility decision.

The approximately `0.02` ΔEOK just-noticeable-difference value used in CSS
gamut-mapping context is policy layered above the primitive.

`deltaEOK` therefore does not classify:

- equal versus different;
- perceptible versus imperceptible;
- pass versus fail.

A named JND helper requires separate consumer justification.

## 17.7 deltaEOK2 and other Delta-E algorithms

`deltaEOK2` is a distinct algorithm and must not be conflated with
`deltaEOK`.

It remains deferred until standards or concrete consumer requirements justify
separate research and implementation.

CIELAB-based Delta-E variants such as `deltaE76` and `deltaE2000` likewise
remain deferred until CIELAB support becomes a concrete requirement.

## 17.8 Squared-distance API

R0.10 found no consumer requirement for:

```d
deltaEOKSquared
```

No such public API should be added speculatively.

## 17.9 Research status

R0.10 validated the mathematical contract, finite-range behavior,
special-value policy, CTFE/UFCS shape and the preferred numerical
implementation direction.

The experiment and detailed numerical evidence live in:

```text
docs/research/R0_10_DELTA_E_OK.md
experiments/r0_10_delta_e_ok/
```

Public API promotion remains an R1 task and is not frozen by R0.10.

---

# 18. Gamut mapping

Gamut membership, clipping and perceptual gamut mapping are distinct
operations.

Ordinary color-space conversion must not implicitly clip or gamut-map
extended values.

The initial concrete target gamut is sRGB.

## 18.1 Gamut membership

Strict gamut membership is a diagnostic query.

For the initial sRGB target, encoded sRGB and linear sRGB use the same
component-domain membership condition:

```text
0 <= r <= 1
0 <= g <= 1
0 <= b <= 1
```

A numerical tolerance around the boundary is a separate numerical-policy
concern. It must not redefine the geometric gamut.

Non-finite values are not considered in gamut and are not silently repaired.

## 18.2 Clipping

Hard component clipping is an explicit target-space operation.

It is distinct from perceptual gamut mapping and therefore must not be a
`GamutMapMethod` variant.

Clipping may alter hue and perceived color, but remains useful where the
caller explicitly requests hard target-coordinate saturation.

## 18.3 Perceptual gamut mapping

The architecture shall allow multiple explicit perceptual mapping methods.

The initial validated candidates are:

```d
enum GamutMapMethod
{
    // names provisional
    localMinde,
    rayTrace
}
```

No public default mapping method is frozen at this stage.

### Local MINDE

Local MINDE remains the standards-oriented / perceptual reference candidate.

R0.8 observed:

- adaptive iterative search;
- useful perceptual/reference behavior;
- substantially higher dynamic cost than Ray Trace on the measured system.

### Ray Trace

Ray Trace remains the bounded-cost / performance-oriented candidate.

R0.8 observed:

- a fixed small iteration budget;
- substantially fewer dynamic instructions and branches than Local MINDE;
- predictable bounded work;
- no requirement for an external lookup table.

The validated optimized implementation can avoid repeated `atan2` in the
iterative projection path.

The RGB-cube intersection helper is also a justified explicit-inline
candidate based on timing, hardware-counter and generated-code evidence.

These performance results are implementation evidence from the measured
x86-64/LDC system, not universal cross-platform guarantees.

## 18.4 Fast-path and alpha semantics

Already in-gamut colors shall take the identity / fast path and must not enter
the iterative mapping process.

Per-color gamut mapping transforms color coordinates, not alpha. Alpha is
preserved.

A premultiplied compositing representation must not be interpreted directly
as ordinary RGB coordinates for gamut mapping.

## 18.5 Policy boundary

The mapping method should remain explicit wherever policy matters until
consumer evidence establishes whether a default is desirable.

EdgeSeeker remains deferred.

Per-color scalar gamut mapping in `color-d` is not a complete photographic
rendering intent. Image-wide rendering, spatial adaptation and raster-wide
policy remain consumer responsibilities, primarily in `imagery-d`.

The strategy must remain replaceable and must never become implicit behavior
of ordinary conversions.

---

# 19. Tone scales and palettes

`color-d` shall provide low-level perceptual tone-scale primitives because
there are concrete consumers in GUI styling, map rendering and compile-time
theme construction.

R0.11 validated the mathematical and architectural boundary for these
primitives.

A tone scale is not one universal aesthetic algorithm.

The low-level model is composed from explicit operations over OKLCH values.

## 19.1 Primitive decomposition

The validated primitive operations are conceptually equivalent to:

```d
withLightness(color, lightness)
withChroma(color, chroma)
withHue(color, hue)
```

Each operation replaces exactly one stored component and preserves the other
components.

They are raw mathematical operations.

They must not implicitly:

```text
clamp lightness
canonicalize chroma
normalize hue
gamut-map
assign semantic palette meaning
```

This decomposition allows higher-level tone construction to remain explicit.

## 19.2 Lightness and chroma schedules

Tone families may be constructed from explicit component schedules.

Conceptually:

```text
seed OKLCH color
+
lightness schedule
+
chroma schedule
    ↓
raw OKLCH tone family
```

Caller-supplied schedules are authoritative.

The library shall not embed one universal lightness or chroma curve into the
lowest-level primitive.

Generated finite interval schedules may exist as a convenience layer, but their
schedule semantics are distinct from tone construction itself.

R0.11 validated generated finite interval schedules for compile-time step
counts of at least two.

Zero- and one-element tone families remain naturally representable through
explicit schedules and must not require ambiguous generated-interval
semantics.

## 19.3 Base-color anchoring

A supplied seed does not override an explicit requested schedule.

If the schedule naturally contains the seed's requested component values, the
seed may remain exactly represented.

If the requested schedule differs from the seed, the schedule remains
authoritative.

The implementation must not silently:

```text
move a schedule point
replace the requested value
choose a nearest anchor
repair the schedule to preserve the seed
```

Any future anchor-forcing policy must be a separate explicit operation.

## 19.4 Hue and chroma semantics

Stored OKLCH hue remains raw data.

The low-level primitive does not normalize negative or multi-turn hue values.

Zero chroma does not erase stored hue.

A powerless hue may therefore remain stored while chroma is zero and become
meaningful again if chroma is later restored.

Negative or extended chroma likewise remains representable at the raw
mathematical layer.

Aesthetic chroma shaping and hue drift belong to explicit higher-level policy.

## 19.5 Gamut boundary

Raw OKLCH tone generation and target-gamut mapping are separate operations.

Conceptually:

```text
raw OKLCH family
        ↓
explicit gamut mapper
        ↓
target-space family
```

Generating a raw tone family must not implicitly:

```text
clip
gamut-map
select a default gamut mapper
rewrite the raw family
```

R0.8's validated perceptual mapping candidates remain explicit policy choices.

R0.11 confirmed that an out-of-gamut raw tone may map successfully to a target
color while the original raw tone family remains unchanged and authoritative.

## 19.6 Representation

For compile-time-known cardinality, the validated representation model is:

```d
Oklch!T[N]
```

For runtime-known cardinality, caller-owned output storage is sufficient:

```d
Oklch!T[]
```

The core operation need not allocate.

A caller-output form should reject length mismatches without partially writing
the output.

R0.11 found no justification for a custom tone-scale container or lazy range
solely for the core primitive.

Public names remain provisional until consumer validation.

## 19.7 Extended and non-finite values

Finite extended OKLCH component values remain valid raw mathematical inputs.

The low-level component operations do not silently restrict values to display
ranges such as:

```text
0 <= L <= 1
C >= 0
0 <= H < 360
```

NaN and positive/negative infinity remain visible to the caller in the tested
raw component operations.

The implementation must not silently repair them.

R0.11 deliberately does not define generated-schedule arithmetic for
non-finite endpoints.

In particular, behavior involving expressions such as:

```text
Inf - Inf
0 * Inf
NaN interpolation
```

must not become an accidental API contract.

Non-finite gamut-mapping semantics are likewise not established by R0.11.

## 19.8 CTFE and allocation policy

The validated low-level operations work through ordinary functions at runtime
and CTFE.

The viable core forms support both:

```text
float
double
```

and should retain, where technically appropriate:

```d
@safe
pure
nothrow
@nogc
```

No CTFE-specific duplicate API family is required.

## 19.9 Numerical policy

The structural tone-scale properties validated by R0.11 do not require one
universal epsilon.

Exact properties such as:

```text
component preservation
cardinality
raw anchor behavior
ordering
NaN classification
infinity sign
representation equivalence
raw-versus-mapped separation
```

should remain distinct from approximate numerical comparison policy.

Library-wide tolerance policy remains a separate concern.

## 19.10 Palette and theme boundary

The low-level tone-scale primitive does not assign semantic roles.

Concepts such as:

```text
accent
warning
success
selected
hovered
road.primary
building.residential
```

remain outside `color-d`.

Higher-level palette/theme generation may combine:

```text
tone schedules
chroma policy
gamut mapping
contrast constraints
semantic role assignment
```

but those policies must remain visible above the mathematical primitive.

R0.11 validates the low-level architecture only.

Public production API names remain provisional until promotion and real
consumer validation.

---

# 20. Theme semantics remain outside color-d

The library does not know concepts such as:

```text
accent
warning
success
selected
hovered
road.primary
building.residential
```

Those are application-level semantics.

Dependency direction:

```text
color-d
    ↓
theme/design-token layer
    ↓
OSM style engine
    ↓
renderer
```

---

# 21. Compile-time evaluation

Compile-time evaluation is a first-class design objective.

All deterministic mathematical core operations should be written such that they can execute both:

- at runtime;
- during D CTFE;

where the language and standard library permit it.

This includes, where practical:

```text
sRGB transfer functions
sRGB ↔ linear sRGB
sRGB ↔ XYZ D65
XYZ ↔ Oklab
Oklab ↔ OKLCH
relative luminance
contrast
interpolation
tone generation
gamut testing
gamut mapping
deltaEOK
```

CTFE capability should be tested explicitly.

Example:

```d
static assert({
    enum c = SRgbf(0.2f, 0.4f, 0.8f);
    enum l = c.toOklab;
    enum r = l.toSRgb;

    return approxEqual(c, r);
}());
```

---

# 22. Compile-time GUI theme generation

Built-in themes should be able to be generated fully during compilation.

Example application architecture:

```d
enum ThemeSeed seed = ...;

static immutable Theme lightTheme =
    makeTheme(seed, ThemeMode.light);

static immutable Theme darkTheme =
    makeTheme(seed, ThemeMode.dark);

static immutable Theme highContrastTheme =
    makeTheme(seed, ThemeMode.highContrast);
```

The compiler may perform:

```text
semantic seed colors
    ↓
OKLCH tone generation
    ↓
chroma adjustment
    ↓
gamut mapping
    ↓
contrast selection
    ↓
hover/focus/selection derivation
    ↓
sRGB/linear conversion
    ↓
final Theme struct
```

The executable then contains only the finished theme values.

No runtime color generation is required for built-in themes.

---

# 23. Compile-time theme validation

Theme generation should support build-time invariants.

For example:

```d
static assert(validateTheme(lightTheme));
```

Validation may verify:

- minimum contrast ratios;
- final colors inside the target gamut;
- monotonic lightness of tone scales;
- valid alpha ranges;
- minimum perceptual separation between selected states;
- consistency of semantic palettes;
- finite color values.

A theme violating required invariants can therefore fail compilation instead of producing a defective runtime result.

---

# 24. `enum` versus `static immutable`

Manifest constants are appropriate for small generation parameters:

```d
enum seed = ...;
```

Generated themes and larger arrays should normally be stored as:

```d
static immutable
```

This gives:

- compile-time calculation;
- one concrete runtime representation;
- no repeated reconstruction of larger compound values.

---

# 25. Precomputed renderer representations

A built-in theme may optionally generate more than one final representation during CTFE.

Using only accepted v0.1 computational types, for example:

```d
struct ThemeColor
{
    SRgbf encoded;
    LinearSRgbf linear;
}
```

This permits:

```text
Theme seed
    ↓ compile time

encoded sRGB representation
linear sRGB representation
consumer-specific renderer/GPU tables
```

A consumer may later convert these values into its own packed or GPU-specific
storage representation. Promotion of a generic packed `SRgb8` / `SRgba8`
type is not required for this architecture.

Runtime initialization can then reduce to simple table access or buffer upload.

Whether duplicate representations are desirable should be decided through profiling.

---

# 26. Runtime theme adaptation

CTFE does not replace runtime rendering adaptation.

Compile-time generation is appropriate for:

- built-in Light themes;
- Dark themes;
- High Contrast themes;
- semantic tone scales;
- fixed design tokens;
- precomputed map styles.

Runtime processing remains necessary for:

- user-selected arbitrary colors;
- theme editors;
- OS-selected appearance;
- animation between themes;
- image-dependent adaptive contrast;
- map-background luminance analysis;
- adaptive casing;
- dynamic imagery overlays;
- future HDR/display-specific processing.

---

# 27. OSM editor usage

`color-d` provides mathematical primitives for the editor but knows nothing about OSM tags.

Example higher-level structure:

```text
Editor Theme
│
├── GUI
│   ├── surfaces
│   ├── text
│   ├── controls
│   └── status
│
├── Map
│   ├── roads
│   ├── buildings
│   ├── water
│   ├── landcover
│   └── relations
│
└── Editing
    ├── selection
    ├── hover
    ├── snapping
    ├── topology
    └── validation
```

Semantic colors may be generated at compile time.

Actual rendering adaptation can then combine those semantic colors with runtime information about the map background.

---

# 28. Adaptive rendering

The editor may use semantic colors as stable identities while adapting visibility through:

- light/dark casing;
- dual casing;
- stroke width;
- alpha;
- patterns;
- local luminance information.

Conceptually:

```text
compile-time semantic style
            +
runtime background information
            ↓
adaptive rendered style
```

The color library provides:

- luminance;
- contrast;
- Oklab/OKLCH;
- gamut mapping;
- compositing.

The renderer decides actual styling.

---

# 29. GPU interoperability

Core color types should be simple POD-like structs with predictable component layout.

Example:

```d
struct Oklab(T)
{
    T l;
    T a;
    T b;
}
```

The library should avoid:

- heap pointers;
- hidden allocations;
- global state;
- graphics API dependencies.

However, `color-d` shall not promise that its native layout directly satisfies every GPU ABI such as:

- `std140`;
- `std430`;
- Vulkan-specific layouts;
- WebGPU alignment rules.

GPU-specific adapters belong in renderer code.

---

# 30. Performance model

`color-d` is not expected to perform complex conversions for millions of map primitives every frame.

Preferred architecture:

```text
color-d
    ↓
style/theme generation
    ↓
cached style tables
    ↓
renderer
    ↓
GPU
```

Frequently used colors should normally be precomputed.

Runtime conversion remains available for:

- user interaction;
- dynamic analysis;
- imagery-dependent adaptation;
- tooling.

The mathematical core itself should nevertheless remain efficient enough for normal hot-path use.

For v0.1, "efficient enough" includes a release-performance gate for
release-critical hot paths. LDC is the performance reference compiler. Where a
direct comparison is meaningful, color-d should be competitive with an
equivalent optimized C++ implementation using the same algorithm, mathematical
semantics, scalar type, deterministic input set, machine and release-oriented
target flags.

The gate does not require every compiler to generate identical performance.
DMD remains a supported correctness/portability target, while compiler-specific
internal runtime optimizations may be selected when reproduced evidence shows a
material backend or standard-library difference and the public API, CTFE
behavior and numerical contracts remain intact.

Performance work must not silently weaken color semantics. In particular,
`-ffast-math` is excluded from the default reference comparison because
NaN/Inf/invalid-state behavior and property-specific numerical contracts are
part of the library design.

---

# 31. Allocation policy

Core color operations should normally allocate nothing.

Preferred properties:

```text
value types
stack-friendly
no GC
no hidden arrays
no global state
```

Public mathematical operations should strive for:

```d
@safe
pure
nothrow
@nogc
```

where semantically and technically appropriate.

---

# 32. Testing strategy

Tests must combine standards vectors, external references and algebraic properties.

Required classes:

## Reference values

Use known vectors for:

```text
sRGB transfer functions
XYZ conversion
Oklab
OKLCH
relative luminance
contrast
gamut mapping
```

## Round-trip tests

Examples:

```text
SRgb → LinearSRgb → SRgb
SRgb → XYZ → SRgb
SRgb → Oklab → SRgb
Oklab → OKLCH → Oklab
```

with scalar-specific tolerances.

## Edge cases

Test:

```text
black
white
RGB primaries
gamut boundaries
out-of-gamut values
alpha = 0
alpha = 1
negative RGB intermediates
components > 1
zero chroma
hue wrapping
NaN
infinity
```

## Property tests

Potential properties:

- identity round trips;
- monotonic tone-scale lightness;
- valid alpha composition bounds;
- gamut-mapped outputs lie inside target gamut;
- hue-path consistency;
- deterministic CTFE/runtime equality.

---

# 33. Numerical tolerances

The project shall not define one universal epsilon.

Tolerance depends on:

- scalar type;
- operation;
- transfer function;
- matrix multiplication;
- trigonometric conversion;
- gamut mapping.

Separate tolerances should be documented for:

```text
float
double
round-trip conversion
reference-vector comparison
boundary classification
```

---

# 34. CTFE/runtime equivalence testing

Core operations intended for CTFE should be tested in both modes.

Example concept:

```d
enum compileTime = someColor.toOklab;

auto runtime = someColor.toOklab;

assert(approxEqual(compileTime, runtime));
```

This guards against accidental divergence when implementations are optimized.

---

# 35. Initial production module structure

R0.14 promotes the following directly supported public-module shape for the
initial v0.1 implementation:

```text
source/color/
    package.d

    rgb.d
    xyz.d
    oklab.d
    oklch.d

    alpha.d
    composite.d
    interpolate.d

    gamut.d
    wcag.d
    difference.d
    tone.d
```

Responsibilities:

- `color.rgb` — encoded/linear sRGB value types, aliases and transfer
  conversion;
- `color.xyz` — `XyzD65!T` and accepted RGB/XYZ conversion;
- `color.oklab` — `Oklab!T` and accepted XYZ/Oklab conversion;
- `color.oklch` — `Oklch!T`, Oklab/OKLCH conversion and raw OKLCH component
  operations;
- `color.alpha` — straight-alpha and premultiplied value types and explicit
  representation transitions;
- `color.composite` — linear-light source-over reference compositing;
- `color.interpolate` — rectangular/polar interpolation and `HuePath`;
- `color.gamut` — gamut diagnostics, clipping and explicit perceptual mapping;
- `color.wcag` — WCAG-2-specific luminance and contrast measurement;
- `color.difference` — explicit perceptual difference operations such as
  `deltaEOK`;
- `color.tone` — low-level OKLCH tone/schedule primitives.

`import color;` is the curated convenience entry point and re-exports the
accepted public v0.1 surface. The modules above are also directly supported
documented imports.

Implementation/helper modules are not part of the supported public contract
merely because D can technically import them.

There is no initial public `palette.d`, `hsl.d` or `hsv.d` module.

Possible later modules remain consumer-driven, for example:

```text
source/color/cie/
    lab.d
    lch.d

source/color/widegamut/
    display_p3.d
    rec2020.d

source/color/picker/
    hsl.d
    hsv.d
    okhsl.d
    okhsv.d
```

Module boundaries may still receive implementation-level ergonomic refinement,
but R1 must preserve the accepted responsibility boundaries and documented
public import surface.

---

# 36. External implementation references

Existing work should be treated as references rather than API templates.

Important references include:

- historical `TurkeyMan/color`;
- `AuburnSounds/colors`;
- `arsd.color`;
- Rust `palette`;
- Color.js;
- modern CSS Color specifications;
- Oklab reference implementation.

The historical `TurkeyMan/color` project is particularly valuable for:

- D-specific generic color types;
- whitepoint handling;
- transfer functions;
- allocation-free implementation techniques;
- `@safe pure nothrow @nogc` design.

However, `color-d` intentionally differs by emphasizing:

- explicit rather than cast-style conversions;
- distinct linear/nonlinear RGB types;
- Oklab/OKLCH as first-class modern spaces;
- explicit extended-range computation;
- orthogonal alpha typing;
- modern gamut semantics.

---

# 37. Accepted v0.1 scope

R0.14 accepts the following production-promotion scope:

```text
SRgb!T
LinearSRgb!T
XyzD65!T
Oklab!T
Oklch!T
    T = float | double

explicit conversions among the validated computational spaces

straight-alpha representation
premultiplied-alpha representation
explicit premultiply / unpremultiply
linear-light source-over compositing

same-space interpolation
OKLCH polar interpolation
HuePath

WCAG-2 relative luminance
WCAG-2 contrast
deltaEOK

inGamut
clip
explicit perceptual gamut mapping
    Local MINDE
    Ray Trace
    no frozen default mapper

low-level OKLCH component/tone/schedule primitives

CTFE support and tests where technically appropriate
allocation-free scalar mathematical operations
```

The following earlier candidates are deliberately not part of v0.1:

```text
SRgb8
SRgba8
Hsl!T
Hsv!T
```

R0.12 also rejects the need for a semantic `Palette`, `Theme`,
`PaletteBuilder` or `ThemeBuilder` abstraction in the mathematical library.
Ordinary arrays plus explicit low-level primitives are the validated model.

---

# 38. Deferred functionality

Later only with concrete consumers:

```text
SRgb8 / SRgba8
HSL / HSV
Display-P3
Rec.2020
CIELAB / LCh
CIEDE2000
Okhsl
Okhsv
CSS parser / serializer
named colors
color-temperature models
scientific palettes
categorical palettes
color-vision-deficiency simulation
HDR
ICC
CMYK
GPU shader helpers
```

---

# 39. Dependency direction

Expected workspace relationships:

```text
color-d
   ↑
imagery-d

color-d
   ↑
theme/style layer
   ↑
OSM editor
```

`color-d` shall not depend on either `imagery-d` or `osm-d`.

---

# 40. Core design statement

The intended identity of the library is:

> **A small, type-safe, allocation-free, modern color mathematics library for D, centered on explicit color spaces, correct linear-light operations and perceptual color workflows.**

The most important properties are not the number of supported color spaces.

They are:

1. semantic type safety;
2. explicit color-space transitions;
3. preservation of mathematically valid out-of-gamut intermediates;
4. correct linear-light operations;
5. modern perceptual workflows through Oklab/OKLCH;
6. explicit alpha and gamut semantics;
7. runtime efficiency;
8. compile-time evaluability;
9. deterministic testability.

---

# 41. Implementation strategy

R0 has completed the architecture/prototype phase. R1--R3 now promote the
accepted scope into production modules while preserving the following validated
concerns:

1. concrete D struct layouts;
2. `float`/`double` generic implementation;
3. explicit conversion API ergonomics;
4. alpha wrapper ergonomics;
5. premultiplied representation;
6. extended-sRGB range behavior;
7. Oklab/OKLCH conversions;
8. CTFE compatibility;
9. compile-time tone generation;
10. compile-time theme generation;
11. compile-time theme validation;
12. promotion of validated gamut semantics and initial mapping candidates;
13. comparison against standards/reference vectors;
14. basic performance and generated-code inspection.

No API is considered release-stable merely because it is promoted from R0.
Before v0.1 publication, both the `imagery-d` consumer gate (#4) and the OSM
editor theme/style consumer gate (#13) must exercise the public surface and any
material API friction must be resolved or deliberately documented.

---

# 42. Working rule for future development

New functionality belongs in `color-d` only when at least one of the following applies:

- it is fundamental to correct color mathematics;
- an existing consumer requires it;
- standards interoperability clearly requires it;
- research shows it is necessary to preserve architectural consistency.

The project should avoid becoming a generic collection of every known color algorithm.

The goal is a small, coherent foundation that can remain stable and trustworthy.
