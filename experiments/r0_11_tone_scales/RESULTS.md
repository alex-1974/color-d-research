# R0.11 results — OKLCH tone-scale research

**Status:** R0.11-A/B/C/D/E/F VALIDATED — R0.11 COMPLETE
**Research block:** R0.11 — OKLCH tone-scale generation
**Validated phases:** R0.11-A — primitive decomposition; R0.11-B — schedule semantics; R0.11-C — chroma and hue policy; R0.11-D — explicit gamut composition; R0.11-E — representation and CTFE; R0.11-F — properties and edge cases

This file records observed results.

It was created only after the experiment had been executed with the historical
color-d compiler baseline.

No public API is established by these results.

---

## 1. Question

R0.11-A asked what the smallest useful mathematical primitive for raw OKLCH
tone generation actually is.

The initial candidates were:

```text
A  rawTone(lightness, chroma, hue)

B  tonesAtLightnesses(
       chroma,
       hue,
       explicitLightnesses
   )

C  tonesFromSeed(
       seed,
       explicitLightnesses
   )

D  anchoredTones(
       seed,
       anchorIndex,
       explicitLightnesses
   )
```

A later composition probe added:

```text
withLightness(color, lightness)

tonesByLightness(
    color,
    explicitLightnesses
)
```

The purpose of that probe was to determine whether B or C contain actual
tone-scale mathematics beyond repeated application of an already meaningful
scalar color operation.

---

## 2. Toolchains

Observed compiler baseline:

```text
DMD64 D Compiler v2.111.0
```

and:

```text
LDC 1.41.0
based on DMD v2.111.0
LLVM 19.1.7
target: x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
host CPU: skylake
```

The experiment reports:

```text
D language version: 2111
```

under both compiler families.

---

## 3. Build matrix

The final R0.11-A candidate was executed under:

```text
DMD 2.111.0  Debug
DMD 2.111.0  Release
LDC 1.41.0   Debug
LDC 1.41.0   Release
```

For each configuration:

```text
float  -> 14 runtime checks PASS
double -> 14 runtime checks PASS
```

Therefore:

```text
28 runtime checks per configuration
4 configurations

112 observed runtime PASS results
0 observed runtime failures
```

The program also contains compile-time `static assert` probes.

Those CTFE probes compiled successfully in all four configurations.

---

## 4. Observed matrix

| Compiler | Build | Runtime result | CTFE |
|---|---|---:|---|
| DMD 2.111.0 | Debug | 28/28 PASS | PASS |
| DMD 2.111.0 | Release | 28/28 PASS | PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Debug | 28/28 PASS | PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Release | 28/28 PASS | PASS |

No compiler/build disagreement was observed in R0.11-A.

---

## 5. Candidate A — `rawTone`

Candidate A is:

```d
rawTone(lightness, chroma, hue)
```

Observed property:

```text
rawTone(L, C, H) == Oklch(L, C, H)
```

for both supported scalar types.

The operation performs no transformation.

It merely constructs the same value that direct `Oklch` construction already
represents.

### R0.11-A conclusion

Candidate A does not currently justify a separate mathematical API.

It is useful as an experiment decomposition probe, but no additional semantics
were discovered.

---

## 6. Candidate B — explicit lightness schedule

Candidate B is conceptually:

```d
tonesAtLightnesses(
    chroma,
    hue,
    lightnesses
)
```

Observed properties for both `float` and `double`:

```text
result[i].l == lightnesses[i]
result[i].c == requested chroma
result[i].h == requested hue
```

All checks passed in all compiler/build configurations.

No:

- clipping;
- gamut mapping;
- hue rotation;
- target-space conversion;
- nonlinear arithmetic

occurs in this phase.

---

## 7. Candidate C — complete seed color

Candidate C is conceptually:

```d
tonesFromSeed(
    seed,
    lightnesses
)
```

Observed:

```text
C(seed) == B(seed.c, seed.h)
```

for the same explicit lightness schedule.

More importantly, two seeds with:

```text
different L
same C
same H
```

produce exactly the same Candidate-C scale.

Observed property:

```text
seed1.l != seed2.l

seed1.c == seed2.c
seed1.h == seed2.h

=>

tonesFromSeed(seed1, positions)
==
tonesFromSeed(seed2, positions)
```

This passed for both scalar types in all tested compiler/build configurations.

### R0.11-A conclusion

Candidate C does not use the complete semantic content of its `Oklch` input.

Calling that input a generic "seed color" therefore risks hiding the fact that
its original lightness is irrelevant to the generated raw scale.

---

## 8. Scalar `withLightness` probe

The composition probe introduced:

```d
withLightness(color, lightness)
```

with the exact semantics:

```text
result.l = requested lightness
result.c = color.c
result.h = color.h
```

Observed property:

```text
withLightness replaces only L
```

passed for:

```text
float
double
DMD Debug
DMD Release
LDC Debug
LDC Release
CTFE
```

This operation has useful scalar color semantics independent of tone-scale
generation.

It also matches the existing Technical Specification direction for explicit
perceptual manipulation.

---

## 9. Candidate C decomposes exactly into `withLightness`

The experiment compared:

```text
tonesFromSeed(seed, lightnesses)
```

against:

```text
for every L in lightnesses:
    withLightness(seed, L)
```

Observed:

```text
Candidate C
==
repeated withLightness(seed, L[i])
```

exactly.

This result held for:

```text
float
double
runtime
CTFE
DMD
LDC
Debug
Release
```

No tolerance was required because the operation consists only of component
assignment/copying.

---

## 10. Candidate B also decomposes exactly into `withLightness`

The experiment created an arbitrary OKLCH exemplar whose initial lightness was
deliberately unrelated to the requested tone schedule but whose chroma and hue
matched Candidate B.

Conceptually:

```text
exemplar = Oklch(
    arbitrary L,
    requested C,
    requested H
)
```

Then:

```text
tonesByLightness(exemplar, positions)
```

was compared with:

```text
tonesAtLightnesses(
    requested C,
    requested H,
    positions
)
```

Observed:

```text
B == repeated withLightness on same-C/H exemplar
```

exactly in every tested configuration.

### R0.11-A conclusion

Candidate B does not introduce additional color mathematics beyond:

```text
withLightness(color, L)
```

plus mechanical application over multiple requested lightness values.

---

## 11. Scale construction versus scalar color mathematics

The strongest R0.11-A finding is therefore not simply:

```text
Candidate B wins
```

Instead, the decomposition is:

```text
Oklch value
    ↓
withLightness(color, L)
    ↓
repeat over explicit L schedule
    ↓
raw tone collection
```

The first step is scalar color mathematics.

The second step is collection/batch composition.

R0.11-A found no new mathematical color semantics in the batch operation
itself.

This distinction matters for later API design.

A public scale helper may still be justified by:

- ergonomics;
- CTFE convenience;
- fixed-size generation;
- caller-provided buffers;
- consumer usage;

but not because raw scale generation requires a different underlying color
operation.

---

## 12. Candidate D — explicit anchoring

Candidate D is:

```d
anchoredTones(
    seed,
    anchorIndex,
    lightnesses
)
```

Two cases were tested.

### Matching anchor

When:

```text
lightnesses[anchorIndex] == seed.l
```

the experiment observed both:

```text
result[anchorIndex] == seed
```

and:

```text
result lightness schedule == requested schedule
```

There is no conflict.

### Mismatching anchor

When:

```text
lightnesses[anchorIndex] != seed.l
```

the experiment observed:

```text
result[anchorIndex] == seed
```

but therefore necessarily:

```text
result[anchorIndex].l != lightnesses[anchorIndex]
```

and:

```text
schedulePreserved(result, lightnesses) == false
```

This result is structural rather than numerical.

Exact seed anchoring and exact preservation of a contradictory requested
lightness cannot both hold.

---

## 13. Anchor-policy conclusion

Anchoring is not an implicit property of raw tone generation.

It introduces a policy question:

```text
when anchor lightness and requested schedule disagree,
which contract wins?
```

R0.11-A therefore rejects hidden anchoring in the lowest-level raw
tone-generation operation.

If anchoring is useful to a later palette consumer, it should be represented by
an explicitly named operation or policy.

---

## 14. Exactness and numerical tolerance

R0.11-A performs:

- value construction;
- component replacement;
- component copying;
- static-array iteration;
- equality comparison.

It performs no:

- transfer function;
- matrix multiplication;
- square root;
- trigonometry;
- interpolation arithmetic;
- gamut mapping;
- distance calculation.

Therefore exact equality is the appropriate test for the phase-A invariants.

No floating-point approximation tolerance was required.

R0.11-A does not establish any library-wide tolerance policy.

---

## 15. Extended values observed in the decomposition probe

The composition probe deliberately used an exemplar with:

```text
L = -0.25
```

while generating a scale from unrelated requested lightness values.

Its initial lightness had no effect on the resulting B-equivalent scale.

This provides limited phase-A evidence that the simple scalar/batch
decomposition does not inherently require a nominal `[0,1]` input lightness
for the exemplar.

This is not yet the complete R0.11 extended-value decision.

Full extended-value semantics remain assigned to later R0.11 work.

---

## 16. CTFE

Compile-time probes validated:

- direct `rawTone`;
- explicit lightness schedule generation;
- seed form;
- matching anchored form;
- scalar `withLightness`;
- repeated `withLightness`;
- equivalence of Candidate C and repeated `withLightness`;
- equivalence of Candidate B and repeated `withLightness` on a same-C/H
  exemplar.

The same ordinary experiment functions are used at compile time and runtime.

No separate CTFE-specific API exists.

---

## 17. Attributes and allocation shape

The tested scalar and fixed-size operations compile with the intended
research attributes:

```d
@safe
pure
nothrow
@nogc
```

The fixed-size candidates return static arrays:

```d
Oklch!T[N]
```

and require no explicit heap or GC allocation in the experiment.

R0.11-A does not yet decide whether a static-array batch helper belongs in the
future public API.

Runtime-sized output and caller-provided buffers remain later R0.11 questions.

---

## 18. Performance

No runtime microbenchmark was performed.

R0.11-A contains no demonstrated performance-sensitive numerical kernel.

The relevant operations are component assignment and fixed-size iteration.

A nanosecond benchmark would not answer the phase-A architecture question and
would be speculative.

Project-wide performance/compiler retesting remains tracked separately.

---

## 19. R0.11-A decisions

R0.11-A supports the following research decisions.

### Accepted

1. `withLightness(Oklch, L)` is a meaningful independent scalar primitive.
2. Raw explicit-position scale generation can be expressed mechanically by
   repeated `withLightness`.
3. Candidate C is exactly repeated `withLightness(seed, L[i])`.
4. Candidate B is likewise reducible to repeated `withLightness` on any OKLCH
   value carrying the requested chroma and hue.
5. Exact anchoring is separate policy.
6. Hidden anchor override does not belong in the lowest-level raw primitive.
7. No tolerance is required for these exact component-preservation properties.
8. The tested operations are viable for CTFE and the intended core attributes
   on the historical DMD/LDC baseline.

### Not justified by phase A

R0.11-A does not justify a separate public:

```text
rawTone(...)
```

operation.

It also does not yet justify freezing public:

```text
tonesAtLightnesses(...)
tonesFromSeed(...)
tonesByLightness(...)
anchoredTones(...)
toneScale(...)
```

names or signatures.

These remain experiment vocabulary.

---

## 20. Architectural result

The current preferred decomposition after R0.11-A is:

```text
Oklch construction
        ↓
withLightness(color, L)
        ↓
application over an explicit L schedule
        ↓
optional chroma policy
        ↓
explicit gamut mapping
        ↓
explicit target-space conversion
```

Only the first two layers have been examined sufficiently in phase A.

Whether the application-over-schedule layer deserves a reusable public helper
depends on later:

- schedule semantics;
- output representation;
- CTFE ergonomics;
- runtime-sized generation;
- consumer evidence.

---

## 21. Questions handed to later R0.11 phases

R0.11-A leaves these questions open:

- Should color-d provide a linear lightness-schedule generator?
- Should arbitrary caller-supplied positions be the primary scale interface?
- Does a static-array batch helper materially improve CTFE ergonomics?
- Is a caller-provided runtime output buffer useful?
- What are the correct zero-step and one-step semantics?
- Should nonlinear schedules live in color-d or in palette policy?
- What chroma policies are useful and which are aesthetic?
- How should powerless/achromatic hue interact with generated scales?
- What finite extended input contract should scale helpers use?
- What should happen for NaN and infinity?
- How should explicit R0.8 gamut mapping compose with raw scales?
- Is `deltaEOK` useful only diagnostically or does any spacing primitive merit
  exposure?

These questions belong to R0.11-B through R0.11-F.

---

## 22. Phase-A conclusion

R0.11-A validates a smaller architecture than the original `toneScale(...)`
sketch suggested.

The fundamental raw mathematical operation is currently:

```text
replace OKLCH lightness while preserving chroma and hue
```

represented experimentally by:

```d
withLightness(color, L)
```

A raw tone scale is then mechanically obtained by applying this operation over
explicit lightness positions.

The batch operation may still deserve an API for ergonomics or CTFE, but R0.11-A
found no additional color mathematics in that layer.

Exact base anchoring is a separate, potentially conflicting policy and must
remain explicit.

R0.11 remains in progress.

---

## R0.11-B results — schedule semantics

**Status:** VALIDATED
**Phase:** R0.11-B — schedule semantics

R0.11-B studied the lightness schedule itself after R0.11-A established that
raw tone construction decomposes into:

```text
withLightness(color, L)
```

applied over a sequence of requested lightness values.

No public API is established by these results.

### B.1 Observed compiler matrix

The final R0.11-B candidate was executed under:

```text
DMD 2.111.0  Debug
DMD 2.111.0  Release
LDC 1.41.0   Debug
LDC 1.41.0   Release
```

Each configuration executed the complete R0.11-A and R0.11-B runtime suite:

```text
82 PASS
0 FAIL
```

Therefore the observed final matrix totals:

```text
4 configurations
82 runtime checks per configuration

328 PASS
0 FAIL
```

The compile-time probes also compiled successfully in all four configurations.

Observed matrix:

| Compiler | Build | Result |
|---|---|---:|
| DMD 2.111.0 | Debug | 82/82 PASS |
| DMD 2.111.0 | Release | 82/82 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Debug | 82/82 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Release | 82/82 PASS |

No final hybrid-property disagreement was observed between compiler families or
build modes.

### B.2 Explicit schedules

Caller-supplied positions were tested independently from generated intervals.

Observed:

```text
N == 0
```

is naturally representable as an empty explicit position sequence and produces
an empty tone collection.

Observed:

```text
N == 1
```

is also unambiguous when the caller supplies the position explicitly.

For example:

```text
[0.42]
```

means exactly one requested tone at:

```text
L = 0.42
```

No endpoint or midpoint policy is involved.

### B.3 Generated inclusive intervals

A generated inclusive endpoint schedule has different semantics.

For:

```text
N == 2
```

the observed and intended result is exactly:

```text
[start, end]
```

The experiment explicitly constrains the generated inclusive schedule
candidates to:

```text
N >= 2
```

Compile-time probes confirm that the weighted generated candidate:

```text
N == 0  -> does not compile
N == 1  -> does not compile
N == 2  -> compiles
```

This is deliberate experiment semantics rather than a D language limitation.

### B.4 Singleton ambiguity

R0.11-B compared three explicit interpretations for a generated interval with:

```text
N == 1
```

namely:

```text
[start]
[midpoint]
[end]
```

For the probe interval:

```text
start = 0.20
end   = 0.80
```

the three policies produce distinct values.

Therefore the phrase:

```text
inclusive linear schedule from start to end with one sample
```

does not identify one unique mathematical result.

R0.11-B consequently supports keeping generic generated inclusive endpoint
schedules constrained to:

```text
N >= 2
```

rather than silently selecting a singleton policy.

Explicit caller-supplied schedules remain free to contain one value.

### B.5 Ascending and descending schedules

Generated schedules were tested in both directions.

Observed:

```text
0.10 -> 0.90
```

is nondecreasing and preserves both endpoints exactly.

Observed:

```text
0.90 -> 0.10
```

is nonincreasing and preserves both endpoints exactly.

No separate ascending and descending generation algorithms are required.

### B.6 Finite extended lightness

The raw schedule layer was tested with:

```text
start = -0.50
end   =  1.50
```

The generated values remained ordinary finite mathematical values and preserved
the expected order and endpoints.

R0.11-B therefore found no mathematical reason for the raw schedule generator
itself to clamp lightness to:

```text
[0, 1]
```

This does not establish the final public non-finite or domain contract.

NaN and infinity remain later R0.11 questions.

### B.7 Direct-difference interpolation candidate

The straightforward interior formula was:

```text
start + (end - start) * t
```

For ordinary ranges it behaves as expected.

However, R0.11-B deliberately tested finite opposite-sign endpoints:

```text
start =  0.75 * T.max
end   = -0.75 * T.max
```

Both endpoints are finite.

Their full difference is not representable in the same scalar type.

For:

```text
t = 0.5
```

the mathematically expected result is:

```text
0
```

Observed in every tested compiler/build/scalar combination:

```text
direct-difference formula loses finite midpoint
```

The direct-difference expression therefore does not satisfy the desired
finite-range property for the complete finite endpoint domain.

### B.8 Weighted-endpoint interpolation candidate

The second candidate was:

```text
(1 - t) * start + t * end
```

For the large opposite-sign probe it avoided formation of the overflowing full
difference.

Observed in every tested configuration:

```text
weighted midpoint is finite
weighted symmetric midpoint == 0
exact externally assigned endpoints are preserved
```

This resolves the concrete opposite-sign range failure of the direct formula.

However, R0.11-B also tested equal large endpoints.

For:

```text
start == end
```

a mathematically constant schedule should contain exactly that value at every
position.

The weighted candidate was observed as:

```text
weighted equal-endpoint exact: NO
```

for every tested combination:

```text
DMD Debug    float   NO
DMD Debug    double  NO

DMD Release  float   NO
DMD Release  double  NO

LDC Debug    float   NO
LDC Debug    double  NO

LDC Release  float   NO
LDC Release  double  NO
```

Therefore the pure weighted formula is not accepted as the general
R0.11-B schedule-interpolation candidate.

Its weakness was repeatable across the complete historical compiler matrix.

### B.9 Hybrid candidate

The final phase-B candidate chooses the arithmetic form according to endpoint
signs.

Conceptually:

```text
strictly opposite signs
    -> weighted-endpoint expression

otherwise
    -> direct-difference expression
```

The experimental scalar operation is equivalent to:

```text
if start and end have strictly opposite signs:
    (1 - t) * start + t * end
else:
    start + (end - start) * t
```

The generated schedule writes:

```text
result[0]     = start
result[N - 1] = end
```

explicitly and applies the interpolation expression only to interior samples.

This separates exact endpoint preservation from interior floating-point
arithmetic.

### B.10 Equal-endpoint property

For equal large endpoints, the direct and hybrid candidates were tested over an
11-element generated schedule.

Observed in all tested configurations:

```text
direct formula preserves equal-endpoint constant schedule
hybrid formula preserves equal-endpoint constant schedule
```

while the pure weighted candidate produced the separate observation:

```text
weighted equal-endpoint exact: NO
```

The hybrid candidate therefore retains the useful exact constant-schedule
property of the direct form.

### B.11 Same-sign large endpoints

The hybrid candidate was tested with large same-sign finite endpoints:

```text
start = 0.75 * T.max
end   = 0.50 * T.max
```

Observed:

```text
all tested interior values remain finite
schedule remains nonincreasing
```

Because the endpoints have the same sign, the direct-difference branch does not
form the large opposite-sign span that caused the earlier overflow failure.

### B.12 Opposite-sign large endpoints

The hybrid candidate was also retested with:

```text
start =  0.75 * T.max
end   = -0.75 * T.max
```

Observed in every configuration and scalar type:

```text
midpoint remains finite
symmetric midpoint == 0 exactly
endpoints remain exact
```

Thus the hybrid candidate retains the finite-range advantage of the weighted
expression where that advantage is required.

### B.13 Representative finite-domain property sweep

The final experiment used this deterministic endpoint set for each scalar type:

```text
-0.75 * T.max
-2
-1
-T.min_normal
-0.0
 0
 T.min_normal
 0.25
 1
 2
 0.75 * T.max
```

This produces:

```text
11 * 11 = 121
```

ordered endpoint pairs.

For every pair, the hybrid candidate generated:

```text
17
```

samples.

Therefore the representative sweep generated:

```text
121 * 17 = 2057
```

schedule values per scalar type and compiler/build configuration.

Across:

```text
2 scalar types
4 compiler/build configurations
```

the final matrix exercised:

```text
16,456
```

representative generated schedule values in this sweep.

This number describes generated values, not independent test assertions.

### B.14 Sweep properties

For every representative endpoint pair, the experiment checked:

```text
finite output
monotonicity in the endpoint direction
boundedness within the closed endpoint interval
exact first endpoint
exact last endpoint
exact constant schedule when start == end
```

Observed for both `float` and `double`, under all four configurations:

```text
PASS  hybrid representative sweep remains finite
PASS  hybrid representative sweep remains monotonic
PASS  hybrid representative sweep remains within endpoints
PASS  hybrid representative sweep preserves exact endpoints
PASS  hybrid representative equal endpoints remain exact
```

No counterexample was found in the representative sweep.

This is strong empirical evidence for the tested domain.

It is not a formal proof over every finite IEEE-754 value.

### B.15 Composition with R0.11-A

R0.11-B keeps schedule generation separate from color manipulation.

The experiment composes:

```text
generated lightness schedule
            ↓
tonesByLightness(seed, schedule)
            ↓
repeated withLightness(seed, L)
```

Observed:

```text
generated schedule composes mechanically with phase A
```

while preserving:

```text
the generated L schedule
seed chroma
seed hue
```

No extra color mathematics is introduced by the schedule layer.

### B.16 Current architectural decomposition

After R0.11-A and R0.11-B, the current research decomposition is:

```text
scalar OKLCH operation
    withLightness(color, L)

        ↓

lightness positions

    caller-supplied:
        N = 0, 1, 2, ...

    or generated inclusive interval:
        N >= 2

        ↓

robust finite interior schedule arithmetic

    same-sign / equal:
        direct-difference form

    strictly opposite-sign:
        weighted-endpoint form

        ↓

raw tone collection
```

This is a decomposition result, not a frozen public API.

### B.17 Phase-B decisions

R0.11-B supports the following research decisions.

Accepted:

1. Caller-supplied explicit positions naturally support `N == 0`.
2. Caller-supplied explicit positions naturally support `N == 1`.
3. A generic generated inclusive endpoint schedule should require `N >= 2`
   unless a separate singleton policy is explicitly requested.
4. Ascending and descending schedules use the same abstraction.
5. Exact generated endpoints should be assigned explicitly.
6. Raw finite lightness schedules need not be restricted to `[0,1]`.
7. The pure direct-difference expression is insufficient over the tested full
   finite endpoint range because opposite-sign endpoint subtraction can
   overflow.
8. The pure weighted-endpoint expression fixes that concrete range problem but
   loses exact constant-schedule behavior in the tested compiler matrix.
9. The tested hybrid candidate combines the useful properties of both forms for
   the investigated finite schedule domain.
10. Schedule generation remains separate from `withLightness` and raw tone
    construction.
11. No separate ascending/descending API is justified.
12. No implicit seed anchoring is introduced by schedule generation.

### B.18 Not established by R0.11-B

R0.11-B does not establish:

- a general-purpose public `lerp` API;
- final public names for schedule helpers;
- runtime-sized output representation;
- caller-buffer APIs;
- nonlinear/eased schedule policy;
- chroma shaping;
- hue policy;
- NaN semantics;
- infinity semantics;
- gamut mapping policy;
- target-space conversion policy;
- perceptual-distance-equalized schedules;
- a universal floating-point interpolation theorem.

The hybrid helper remains research vocabulary until later R0.11 phases and
consumer validation justify a production boundary.

### B.19 Phase-B conclusion

R0.11-B validates a clean distinction between:

```text
explicit positions
```

and:

```text
generated inclusive endpoint schedules
```

Explicit positions require no special zero- or one-element policy.

Generated inclusive endpoint schedules are semantically clean from:

```text
N >= 2
```

onward.

For finite endpoints, the tested hybrid arithmetic avoids the observed
opposite-sign overflow failure of the direct formula while preserving the exact
constant-schedule property that the pure weighted formula lost.

The complete historical DMD/LDC matrix passed with no hybrid-property
disagreement.

R0.11-B is therefore complete.

R0.11 remains in progress.

## R0.11-C results — chroma and hue policy

**Status:** VALIDATED
**Phase:** R0.11-C — chroma and hue policy

R0.11-C studied whether chroma and hue require additional tone-scale
mathematics after R0.11-A and R0.11-B had already separated scalar component
operations from schedule generation.

No public API is established by these results.

### C.1 Observed compiler matrix

The final R0.11-C candidate was executed under:

```text
DMD 2.111.0  Debug
DMD 2.111.0  Release
LDC 1.41.0   Debug
LDC 1.41.0   Release
```

Each configuration executed the complete accumulated R0.11-A/B/C runtime
suite:

```text
108 PASS
0 FAIL
```

Therefore the accumulated matrix totals:

```text
4 configurations
108 runtime checks per configuration

432 PASS
0 FAIL
```

R0.11-C contributes:

```text
13 checks per scalar type
2 scalar types
4 compiler/build configurations

104 phase-C runtime PASS results
0 phase-C runtime failures
```

The compile-time R0.11-C probes also compiled successfully in all four
configurations.

Observed matrix:

| Compiler | Build | Accumulated result |
|---|---|---:|
| DMD 2.111.0 | Debug | 108/108 PASS |
| DMD 2.111.0 | Release | 108/108 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Debug | 108/108 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Release | 108/108 PASS |

No compiler/build disagreement was observed in the phase-C properties.

### C.2 Scalar `withChroma`

The experiment introduced the research-local scalar operation:

```d
withChroma(color, chroma)
```

with raw semantics:

```text
replace C
preserve L
preserve stored H
```

Observed for both supported scalar types and all compiler/build
configurations:

```text
PASS  withChroma replaces only C
```

No:

- clipping;
- gamut mapping;
- hue modification;
- hue normalization;
- chroma canonicalization

is performed by this operation.

### C.3 Scalar `withHue`

The experiment also introduced:

```d
withHue(color, hue)
```

with raw semantics:

```text
replace stored H
preserve L
preserve C
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  withHue replaces only H
```

in the complete matrix.

R0.11-C therefore found no need to couple raw hue replacement to tone-scale
generation.

### C.4 Explicit lightness and chroma schedules

The experiment formed a raw component scale from:

```text
L[0 .. N]
C[0 .. N]
one stored seed hue
```

using repeated scalar composition conceptually equivalent to:

```text
withChroma(
    withLightness(seed, L[i]),
    C[i]
)
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  explicit component scale preserves L schedule
PASS  explicit component scale preserves C schedule
PASS  explicit component scale preserves seed hue
```

The requested lightness and chroma values are copied exactly.

No additional nonlinear color computation is involved.

### C.5 Equivalence to scalar composition

For every tested element, the batch/component candidate was compared with
explicit repeated scalar operations.

Observed:

```text
PASS  component scale equals repeated scalar composition
```

Therefore R0.11-C found no additional color mathematics in the batch
lightness/chroma zip itself.

As with R0.11-A, a future batch helper may still be useful for ergonomics or
CTFE, but that is separate from mathematical necessity.

### C.6 Constant chroma

The experiment represented constant chroma as:

```text
C[i] = seed.c
```

for all positions.

That explicit constant-C schedule was compared with the R0.11-A operation that
changes only lightness.

Observed:

```text
PASS  constant chroma is an explicit constant C schedule
```

Therefore constant chroma does not require a distinct tone-generation
primitive.

It is a special case of explicit component scheduling.

### C.7 Generated scalar schedule used as chroma

R0.11-B's validated research schedule candidate was used to create a sequence
of chroma values.

That sequence was then consumed mechanically as component data.

Observed:

```text
PASS  generated scalar schedule composes mechanically as chroma
```

while preserving:

```text
requested L values
generated C values
stored seed hue
```

This does not establish that arbitrary linear chroma ramps are aesthetically
desirable.

It establishes only that schedule generation and component application compose
cleanly.

### C.8 Powerless hue at zero chroma

R0.11-C explicitly tested:

```text
C = 0
```

The stored hue was retained.

Observed:

```text
PASS  zero chroma preserves stored powerless hue
```

The experiment also created two zero-chroma values carrying different stored
hues.

Observed:

```text
PASS  powerless hues remain representationally distinct
```

Thus perceptual powerlessness is not treated as representational absence.

This is consistent with the raw OKLCH direction inherited from R0.5.

### C.9 Restoring chroma

After reducing chroma to zero, the experiment restored the original nonzero
chroma without replacing hue.

Observed:

```text
PASS  restoring chroma preserves previously stored hue
```

The stored powerless hue therefore survives a temporary zero-chroma state and
can become meaningful again when chroma becomes nonzero.

R0.11-C found no justification for silently erasing hue at `C == 0`.

### C.10 Raw hue remains unnormalized

The phase-C probe explicitly stored:

```text
H = 725 degrees
```

through `withHue`.

Observed:

```text
PASS  raw hue replacement does not normalize
```

The stored value remained exactly:

```text
725 degrees
```

No implicit positive or signed hue normalization is part of raw component
replacement.

Normalization remains an explicit operation/policy.

### C.11 Negative chroma remains raw

The experiment applied:

```text
C = -0.10
```

through `withChroma`.

Observed:

```text
PASS  raw negative chroma is not implicitly canonicalized
```

The stored chroma remained negative and the stored hue remained unchanged.

R0.11-C therefore does not reopen or duplicate the explicit canonicalization
semantics established earlier in R0.5.

### C.12 CTFE and attributes

The phase-C operations were exercised through compile-time probes using the
same ordinary functions as runtime.

The probes validated:

- scalar chroma replacement;
- scalar hue replacement;
- zero-chroma hue preservation;
- chroma restoration;
- explicit L/C component scale construction;
- L schedule preservation;
- C schedule preservation;
- hue preservation.

They compiled successfully in all four historical compiler/build
configurations.

The research candidates retain the intended core attributes:

```d
@safe
pure
nothrow
@nogc
```

No CTFE-specific API is required.

### C.13 Architectural boundary

After R0.11-C, the low-level decomposition is:

```text
withLightness(color, L)
withChroma(color, C)
withHue(color, H)

        ↓

explicit component values / schedules

        ↓

mechanical raw OKLCH construction
```

The following operations are not implied by that layer:

```text
aesthetic chroma shaping
automatic endpoint desaturation
gamut-dependent chroma reduction
hue-path interpolation
hue normalization
canonicalization
gamut mapping
target-space conversion
```

Those concerns require explicit higher-level policy or already belong to
separate validated subsystems.

### C.14 Chroma-shaping conclusion

R0.11-C found no mathematical basis for automatically reducing chroma merely
because a tone becomes very light or very dark.

Such behavior may be useful for:

- palette aesthetics;
- target-gamut feasibility;
- UI design systems;
- consumer-specific palette constraints.

But those are policy inputs, not intrinsic properties of raw OKLCH tone-scale
construction.

Therefore a future low-level tone-scale primitive should not silently invent a
chroma curve.

### C.15 Hue-policy conclusion

Likewise, R0.11-C found no need for raw tone generation to:

- normalize hue;
- erase powerless hue;
- rotate hue aesthetically;
- choose an interpolation hue path.

If a scale intentionally varies hue, the values or interpolation policy should
be explicit.

Hue interpolation remains conceptually separate from simple raw component
replacement.

### C.16 Phase-C decisions

R0.11-C supports the following research decisions.

Accepted:

1. `withChroma` is a meaningful independent scalar component operation.
2. `withHue` is a meaningful independent scalar component operation.
3. Explicit L and C schedules can be combined mechanically.
4. The component zip is exactly reducible to repeated scalar composition.
5. Constant chroma is only a constant C schedule.
6. A generated scalar schedule can be consumed mechanically as chroma data.
7. Zero chroma does not require erasing stored hue.
8. Different stored hues may remain representationally distinct at zero
   chroma.
9. Restoring chroma can reuse the previously stored hue.
10. Raw hue replacement does not normalize implicitly.
11. Raw negative chroma does not canonicalize implicitly.
12. No implicit chroma-shaping curve belongs in the lowest raw tone layer.
13. No implicit gamut-aware chroma reduction belongs in this phase.
14. No separate constant-chroma mathematical primitive is justified.

### C.17 Not established by R0.11-C

R0.11-C does not establish:

- a preferred aesthetic chroma curve;
- perceptually optimal chroma variation;
- a default maximum chroma;
- gamut-dependent chroma caps;
- automatic endpoint desaturation;
- a default gamut mapper;
- hue-rotation aesthetics;
- a new hue-interpolation algorithm;
- public batch-helper names or signatures;
- final runtime output representation;
- final NaN/infinity policy.

Those remain outside phase C or belong to later R0.11 work.

### C.18 Phase-C conclusion

R0.11-C validates that chroma and hue remain composable raw component
semantics rather than hidden tone-scale policy.

The current decomposition is:

```text
explicit or generated scalar component values
                ↓
withLightness / withChroma / withHue
                ↓
raw OKLCH tone family
```

Constant chroma is merely a constant component schedule.

Powerless hue remains stored rather than being erased.

Raw hue remains unnormalized.

Raw negative chroma remains uncanonicalized.

Automatic chroma shaping, hue aesthetics and gamut-dependent adjustment remain
separate explicit policies.

R0.11-C is therefore complete.

R0.11 remains in progress.

## R0.11-D results — explicit gamut composition

**Status:** VALIDATED
**Phase:** R0.11-D — explicit gamut composition

R0.11-D tested composition of the raw OKLCH tone-family semantics established
by R0.11-A through R0.11-C with the already validated R0.8 sRGB gamut layer.

R0.11-D did not redesign or re-evaluate the gamut-mapping algorithms.

### D.1 Reused R0.8 semantics

The validated R0.8 research implementation was exposed through a reusable
research fixture.

R0.11 imported it under an explicit module alias:

```d
import gamut = r0_8_gamut_fixture;
```

The two research type systems remained deliberately distinct.

A narrow adapter:

```d
toR08Oklch(...)
```

copies:

```text
L
C
stored H
```

from the R0.11 OKLCH representation into the R0.8 fixture representation.

No gamut policy is performed by this adapter.

### D.2 Mapping candidates

R0.11-D reused the two validated R0.8 perceptual mapping candidates:

```text
Local MINDE
Ray Trace
```

No public default mapper was selected.

Both remain explicit downstream choices.

### D.3 Observed compiler matrix

The final R0.11-D candidate was executed under:

```text
DMD 2.111.0  Debug
DMD 2.111.0  Release
LDC 1.41.0   Debug
LDC 1.41.0   Release
```

Each configuration executed the complete accumulated R0.11-A/B/C/D runtime
suite:

```text
134 PASS
0 FAIL
```

Therefore the accumulated matrix totals:

```text
4 configurations
134 runtime checks per configuration

536 PASS
0 FAIL
```

R0.11-D contributes:

```text
13 checks per scalar type
2 scalar types
4 compiler/build configurations

104 phase-D runtime PASS results
0 phase-D runtime failures
```

The R0.11-D compile-time probes also compiled successfully in all four
configurations.

Observed matrix:

| Compiler | Build | Accumulated result |
|---|---|---:|
| DMD 2.111.0 | Debug | 134/134 PASS |
| DMD 2.111.0 | Release | 134/134 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Debug | 134/134 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Release | 134/134 PASS |

No compiler/build disagreement was observed.

### D.4 Raw family may cross the target-gamut boundary

A single raw R0.11 tone family was constructed containing:

```text
one in-sRGB-gamut tone
one out-of-sRGB-gamut tone
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  raw family may contain both in-gamut and out-of-gamut tones
```

Therefore raw tone generation does not imply target-gamut displayability.

An out-of-gamut raw tone is not itself a tone-generation error.

### D.5 Mapping does not mutate the raw family

Both mapping methods were applied downstream of the raw family.

Observed:

```text
PASS  explicit mapping does not mutate raw tone family
```

The raw OKLCH values remain independently observable and authoritative.

Mapping produces a target-space result; it does not rewrite the original
schedule.

### D.6 Cardinality and index correspondence

The element-wise mapping helpers produce exactly one mapping result for each
raw tone.

Observed:

```text
PASS  mapping preserves family cardinality
```

The experiment performs no insertion, deletion, sorting or re-indexing.

Therefore:

```text
raw[i]
```

corresponds directly to:

```text
mapped[i]
```

for the selected mapping method.

### D.7 In-gamut identity path

For the already in-gamut raw tone, both R0.8 mapping algorithms reported:

```text
success == true
iterations == 0
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  in-gamut tone uses mapper identity fast path
```

The mapped target-space value also matched ordinary target conversion:

```text
PASS  in-gamut mapped target equals ordinary target conversion
```

Thus inserting an explicit gamut-mapping stage does not force expensive or
perceptually modifying work on already valid target colors.

### D.8 Out-of-gamut mapping

For the known out-of-gamut high-chroma test tone, both mapping methods:

```text
reported success
produced an in-sRGB-gamut LinearSRgb result
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  out-of-gamut tone maps successfully with both R0.8 methods
```

This validates composition of the same raw tone family with either existing
R0.8 method.

### D.9 Mapping methods remain distinct

The two mapping methods were not required to produce identical results.

For the tested out-of-gamut tone they produced distinct valid target colors.

Observed:

```text
PASS  mapping methods may produce distinct valid target colors
```

R0.11-D therefore reinforces the R0.8 decision not to collapse mapping policy
into one hidden universal algorithm.

### D.10 Batch mapping contains no new color mathematics

The phase-D family helpers were compared against applying the selected R0.8
mapper independently to every raw tone.

Observed:

```text
PASS  Local MINDE scale mapping equals independent point-wise mapping
PASS  Ray Trace scale mapping equals independent point-wise mapping
```

Therefore tone-family gamut composition is mechanically element-wise.

R0.11-D found no additional palette-level gamut mathematics in the batch
operation itself.

### D.11 Raw L/C/H schedules remain authoritative

After target mapping, the original R0.11 raw family was checked again.

Observed:

```text
PASS  raw L/C/H schedule remains authoritative after target mapping
```

The exact raw schedule belongs to the tone-generation layer.

Mapped target colors are downstream renderable replacements and are not
required to retain exact raw OKLCH coordinates.

### D.12 Out-of-gamut exact anchors

The experiment explicitly checked an out-of-gamut raw tone whose mapped target
result is in gamut.

Observed:

```text
PASS  out-of-gamut raw anchor cannot remain exact target color
```

This confirms the structural incompatibility between:

```text
preserve an exact out-of-gamut raw color
```

and:

```text
produce an in-target-gamut replacement
```

Exact anchoring therefore belongs to the raw family unless the anchor is
already representable in the destination gamut.

### D.13 Lightness extremes may collapse

R0.8 defines:

```text
L <= 0 -> target black
L >= 1 -> target white
```

R0.11-D supplied multiple distinct raw tones at both extremes.

Observed:

```text
PASS  lightness extremes may collapse to target black or white
PASS  mapped family need not preserve raw uniqueness or component spacing
```

Consequently gamut mapping cannot be assumed to preserve:

```text
raw uniqueness
raw chroma differences
raw spacing
one-to-one perceptual separation
```

These are not valid invariants of the mapped target family.

### D.14 CTFE

The ordinary phase-D adapter and mapping helpers were exercised at compile
time.

The CTFE probes established:

```text
mixed in/out-of-gamut raw family
Local MINDE composition
Ray Trace composition
family cardinality
in-gamut zero-iteration fast path
successful out-of-gamut mapping
in-gamut mapped output
```

They compiled successfully under all four compiler/build configurations.

No CTFE-specific tone/gamut API is required.

### D.15 Architectural result

R0.11-D validates the following separation:

```text
raw tone-generation policy
        |
        | exact L/C/H schedule semantics
        v
raw OKLCH tone family
        |
        | explicit target + explicit mapper
        v
R0.8 gamut mapping
        |
        v
mapped LinearSRgb target family
```

The mapping stage does not feed information back into raw tone generation.

There is no validated primitive architecture of the form:

```text
generate tone
    ↓
detect out of gamut
    ↓
silently change tone-generation schedule
```

If a later higher-level palette policy wants to construct a gamut-aware chroma
schedule, that must be explicit and separate.

### D.16 Phase-D decisions

R0.11-D supports the following research decisions:

1. Raw tone generation remains target-gamut independent.
2. A raw family may legitimately contain in-gamut and out-of-gamut tones.
3. Gamut mapping is an explicit downstream operation.
4. Target and mapping method remain explicit policy choices.
5. Family mapping is mechanically element-wise.
6. Mapping preserves family cardinality and index correspondence.
7. In-gamut tones use the validated R0.8 identity/fast path.
8. Out-of-gamut tones can be mapped by either validated R0.8 method.
9. Local MINDE and Ray Trace may produce different valid target colors.
10. Exact raw L/C/H properties stop at the gamut-mapping boundary.
11. An exact out-of-gamut anchor cannot simultaneously remain exact and become
    representable in the target gamut.
12. Mapped colors may collapse and need not preserve raw uniqueness or spacing.
13. No gamut mapper belongs implicitly inside the raw tone primitive.
14. No public default mapper is established by R0.11-D.
15. No separate tone-scale gamut algorithm is justified.

### D.17 Not established by R0.11-D

R0.11-D does not establish:

- a default gamut mapper;
- that Local MINDE or Ray Trace is universally preferable;
- a gamut-aware aesthetic chroma curve;
- automatic endpoint desaturation;
- Display-P3 behavior;
- Rec.2020 behavior;
- HDR behavior;
- image-wide rendering intent;
- mapped-tone perceptual-spacing guarantees;
- palette-quality heuristics;
- a final production adapter API;
- a final production batch-mapping API.

Those remain separate consumer or research questions.

### D.18 Phase-D conclusion

R0.11-D validates that gamut handling composes cleanly after raw OKLCH
tone-family construction.

The raw tone family remains the authoritative result of the tone-generation
policy.

The destination-gamut layer then explicitly chooses how to obtain renderable
target-space colors.

The validated architecture is therefore:

```text
tone semantics
    ↓
raw OKLCH family
    ↓
explicit gamut policy
    ↓
target-space family
```

There is no evidence that gamut mapping belongs intrinsically inside the raw
tone-scale primitive.

R0.11-D is therefore complete.

R0.11 remains in progress.

---

## R0.11-E results — representation and CTFE

**Status:** VALIDATED
**Phase:** R0.11-E — representation and CTFE

R0.11-E investigated whether the raw tone semantics validated in R0.11-A
through R0.11-D can be represented cleanly for both compile-time-known and
runtime-known cardinalities without introducing allocation into the low-level
primitive.

No new color mathematics was introduced.

### E.1 Final tested source

The final phase-E source had SHA-256:

```text
642756de98383ab54074e76d20cd151b197d8db807827a0975ae657da6e8b3a0
```

The final source contained exactly:

```text
1 ctfeMismatchNoWriteProbe definition
2 ctfeMismatchNoWriteProbe static assertions
```

for `float` and `double`.

### E.2 Compiler matrix

The final source was force-rebuilt and executed under:

```text
DMD 2.111.0  Debug
DMD 2.111.0  Release
LDC 1.41.0   Debug
LDC 1.41.0   Release
```

Observed accumulated result in every configuration:

```text
170 PASS
0 FAIL
```

Matrix:

| Compiler | Build | Accumulated result |
|---|---|---:|
| DMD 2.111.0 | Debug | 170/170 PASS |
| DMD 2.111.0 | Release | 170/170 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Debug | 170/170 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Release | 170/170 PASS |

Therefore the accumulated R0.11-A/B/C/D/E runtime matrix totals:

```text
4 configurations
170 runtime checks per configuration

680 PASS
0 FAIL
```

R0.11-E contributes:

```text
18 checks per scalar type
2 scalar types
4 compiler/build configurations

144 phase-E runtime PASS results
0 phase-E runtime failures
```

No compiler/build disagreement was observed.

### E.3 Fixed-size static-array representation

The existing fixed-size research form:

```d
Oklch!T[N]
```

was exercised for:

```text
N = 0
N = 1
N = 5
N = 32
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  static-array representation supports N=0
PASS  static-array representation supports N=1 and scalar equivalence
PASS  static-array N=5 equals repeated scalar composition
PASS  static-array representation supports N=32
```

The fixed-size representation therefore works naturally when cardinality is a
compile-time value.

No separate tone-scale container is required for this case.

### E.4 Caller-owned output representation

The runtime-sized candidate used caller-owned storage:

```d
Oklch!T[] output
```

with a low-level operation equivalent to:

```d
bool tryTonesAtLightnessAndChromaInto(
    seed,
    lightnesses,
    chromas,
    output);
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  caller-output representation supports empty schedule
PASS  caller-output N=1 equals static-array result
PASS  caller-output N=5 equals static-array result
PASS  caller-output N=32 equals static-array result
```

A caller-provided slice is therefore sufficient for runtime-sized low-level
generation in the tested design.

The primitive itself does not need to allocate output storage.

### E.5 Shared scalar semantics

The static-array and caller-output forms were both compared with repeated
scalar composition.

Observed:

```text
PASS  static-array N=5 equals repeated scalar composition
PASS  caller-output N=5 equals repeated scalar composition
```

Therefore the representation forms do not require separate tone algorithms.

Conceptually:

```text
scalar operation
      |
      +-- repeated into static array
      |
      +-- repeated into caller-owned slice
```

The element semantics remain those established in earlier R0.11 phases.

### E.6 Exact void kernel

A prevalidated exact-write kernel was also exercised:

```d
void tonesAtLightnessAndChromaIntoExact(...)
```

Its caller is responsible for establishing equal lengths before entry.

Observed:

```text
PASS  void exact-write kernel matches static-array result
```

This establishes that a `void` form is mechanically sufficient for an internal
or otherwise prevalidated path.

R0.11-E does not establish it as the best standalone public runtime boundary,
because it cannot itself communicate a dynamic length mismatch.

### E.7 Bool runtime boundary

The explicit runtime boundary returns:

```text
true  -> complete successful write
false -> invalid length relationship
```

The implementation checks all relevant lengths before performing any write.

Both mismatch classes were tested:

```text
lightness count != chroma count
output count != input count
```

Observed for both `float` and `double`:

```text
PASS  bool caller-output rejects component-length mismatch without writes
PASS  bool caller-output rejects output-length mismatch without writes
```

Therefore mismatch behavior is all-or-nothing:

```text
mismatch
    -> false
    -> zero output mutation
```

This avoids implicit truncation and partial output.

### E.8 Empty schedules

The valid empty case is represented naturally:

```text
input length  = 0
output length = 0
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  static-array representation supports N=0
PASS  caller-output representation supports empty schedule
```

The bool boundary can therefore distinguish:

```text
true  + N=0 -> successful empty operation
false       -> length mismatch
```

No special empty-container abstraction is required.

### E.9 Written-count candidate

A comparison candidate returned only the number of elements written:

```d
size_t tonesAtLightnessAndChromaWriteCount(...)
```

Observed:

```text
PASS  written-count candidate reports successful non-empty cardinality
PASS  written-count candidate reports zero for successful empty write
PASS  written-count candidate reports zero for mismatch
PASS  plain written-count cannot distinguish empty success from mismatch
```

Therefore a plain written-count return value is insufficient as the sole
status representation when `N=0` is valid.

Specifically:

```text
0
```

would mean both:

```text
successful empty operation
length mismatch
```

The experiment therefore rejects a bare written-count as the sole error/status
channel for this low-level API shape.

### E.10 CTFE — static-array form

The ordinary fixed-size API was exercised through compile-time evaluation.

Representative compile-time cases included:

```text
N = 0
N = 5
N = 32
float
double
```

The static-array results compiled successfully in all four compiler/build
configurations.

No CTFE-specific static-array API is required.

### E.11 CTFE — caller-output form

The ordinary caller-output function was also used during compile-time
evaluation.

Observed at runtime against compile-time fixtures:

```text
PASS  runtime caller-output result equals CTFE caller-output result
```

for both scalar types in all four compiler/build configurations.

Therefore mutable caller-owned storage does not imply runtime-only use in this
design.

The same ordinary function can participate in CTFE.

### E.12 Runtime/CTFE equivalence

Both representations were compared across runtime and compile-time execution.

Observed:

```text
PASS  runtime static-array result equals CTFE static-array result
PASS  runtime caller-output result equals CTFE caller-output result
```

for:

```text
float
double
DMD Debug
DMD Release
LDC Debug
LDC Release
```

No representation-semantic difference between runtime execution and CTFE was
observed.

### E.13 CTFE mismatch behavior

The final source added explicit compile-time mismatch probes for both scalar
types.

They test both:

```text
component-schedule mismatch
output-size mismatch
```

and require:

```text
return false
output remains unchanged
```

The probes are ordinary:

```d
static assert(...)
```

uses of the same `try...` boundary.

They compiled successfully in all four final matrix configurations.

Therefore the all-or-nothing mismatch contract is valid at CTFE as well as
runtime.

### E.14 Attributes and allocation model

The representation candidates compiled with:

```d
@safe
pure
nothrow
@nogc
```

The caller-output form writes into storage supplied by the caller.

The low-level implementation therefore does not require:

```text
heap allocation
GC allocation
hidden dynamic-array ownership
```

R0.11-E does not claim that every future convenience API must be allocation
free.

It establishes only that the low-level primitive can be.

### E.15 Runtime-sized cardinality

A runtime value cannot become a static-array type parameter.

Therefore:

```text
compile-time-known N
    -> static-array return is natural

runtime-known N
    -> caller-provided storage is natural
```

R0.11-E found no need to introduce a custom dynamic tone-scale container merely
to bridge these two cases.

### E.16 Aliasing

The current inputs are scalar schedules:

```text
T[]
T[]
```

while output is:

```text
Oklch!T[]
```

The tested API therefore does not expose an ordinary same-element-type
input/output aliasing problem.

No additional generalized aliasing abstraction was justified by the phase-E
experiment.

Future APIs with different input/output layouts may need separate analysis.

### E.17 Representation remains policy-free

Neither representation candidate performs or implies:

```text
gamut mapping
clipping
chroma shaping
hue normalization
anchor repair
theme semantics
```

Those policies remain orthogonal.

The representation layer only determines where mechanically generated raw
`Oklch` elements are stored.

### E.18 Candidate architecture

The validated low-level representation model is:

```text
compile-time-known cardinality
        |
        v
Oklch!T[N] return-by-value
        |
        +---- same scalar element semantics
        |
runtime-known cardinality
        |
        v
caller-owned Oklch!T[]
        |
        v
bool success boundary
```

A prevalidated internal path may use:

```text
void exact-write kernel
```

behind the checked boundary.

### E.19 API implications

R0.11-E supports these provisional API conclusions:

1. `Oklch!T[N]` is appropriate when `N` is statically known.
2. Caller-owned `Oklch!T[]` is sufficient for runtime-known cardinality.
3. Both representations can use identical scalar composition semantics.
4. Both representations can remain allocation-free at the low-level layer.
5. Both representations can participate in CTFE.
6. Both representations can retain `@safe pure nothrow @nogc`.
7. `N=0` is a valid successful operation.
8. Runtime length mismatch must not silently truncate.
9. Runtime mismatch can be handled all-or-nothing without exceptions.
10. A bool success boundary distinguishes valid `N=0` from mismatch.
11. A bare written-count does not distinguish those cases and is therefore
    insufficient as the sole status channel.
12. A void exact-write kernel is suitable only when lengths are already
    validated or otherwise guaranteed.
13. No custom tone-scale container is justified by current evidence.
14. No general range/output-range abstraction is justified by current
    evidence.
15. No CTFE-specific API family is justified.

Function names remain provisional.

### E.20 Not established by R0.11-E

R0.11-E does not establish:

- final public API names;
- whether both static and slice forms must be public;
- a high-level allocating convenience API;
- lazy or range-based generation;
- arbitrary output-range support;
- SIMD representation;
- GPU representation;
- palette/theme object design;
- gamut-aware tone generation;
- semantic color roles;
- library-wide tolerance policy;
- final consumer ergonomics.

Those remain separate questions.

### E.21 Phase-E conclusion

R0.11-E validates a simple two-form representation strategy.

For compile-time-known cardinality:

```text
static array
```

is sufficient.

For runtime-known cardinality:

```text
caller-owned output slice
```

is sufficient.

Both can preserve:

```text
the same scalar tone semantics
allocation-free low-level operation
@safe
pure
nothrow
@nogc
CTFE capability
```

A bool runtime boundary provides explicit, all-or-nothing mismatch handling
without making valid empty output ambiguous.

A bare written-count does not.

No additional container abstraction or separate CTFE API is justified by the
observed results.

R0.11-E is therefore complete.

R0.11 remains in progress.

## R0.11-F results — properties and edge cases

**Status:** VALIDATED
**Phase:** R0.11-F — properties and edge cases

R0.11-F is the final integration/property phase of R0.11.

It introduces no new tone-generation algorithm, gamut mapper, container or
numerical-tolerance abstraction.

It tests whether the semantics established by R0.11-A through R0.11-E remain
consistent across:

```text
representative cardinalities
extended finite values
NaN and infinity
monotonic schedules
raw anchors
static and caller-owned representations
runtime and CTFE
explicit gamut composition
```

### F.1 Final tested source

The final R0.11 source had SHA-256:

```text
7705379da8d266fbd1123da2107b1eccce4235fe630d359b143cc1ecdab10da5
```

The source hash was recorded before the final compiler matrix and verified
unchanged after all four forced builds.

### F.2 Final compiler matrix

The final source was force-rebuilt and executed under:

```text
DMD 2.111.0  Debug
DMD 2.111.0  Release
LDC 1.41.0   Debug
LDC 1.41.0   Release
```

Observed result in every configuration:

```text
258 PASS
0 FAIL
exit 0
```

Matrix:

| Compiler | Build | Result |
|---|---|---:|
| DMD 2.111.0 | Debug | 258/258 PASS |
| DMD 2.111.0 | Release | 258/258 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Debug | 258/258 PASS |
| LDC 1.41.0 | Release | 258/258 PASS |

Therefore the final R0.11 runtime matrix totals:

```text
258 checks per configuration
4 configurations

1032 PASS
0 FAIL
```

No compiler/build disagreement was observed.

### F.3 Phase-F contribution

R0.11-F contains three property groups.

```text
F-A finite structural properties
    30 checks per scalar
    2 scalar types
    60 runtime checks per configuration

F-B non-finite raw properties
    12 checks per scalar
    2 scalar types
    24 runtime checks per configuration

F-C cross-phase integration
    2 checks per scalar
    2 scalar types
    4 runtime checks per configuration
```

Therefore:

```text
88 phase-F runtime checks per configuration
4 configurations

352 phase-F PASS
0 phase-F runtime failures
```

The accumulated pre-F total was:

```text
170 checks per configuration
```

and:

```text
170 + 88 = 258
```

### F.4 Cardinality properties

The tested fixed-size cardinalities were:

```text
N = 0
N = 1
N = 2
N = 3
N = 5
N = 17
N = 32
```

Observed for both scalar types:

```text
PASS  N=0 preserves cardinality and representation equivalence
PASS  N=1 preserves cardinality and representation equivalence
PASS  N=2 preserves cardinality and representation equivalence
PASS  N=3 preserves cardinality and representation equivalence
PASS  N=5 preserves cardinality and representation equivalence
PASS  N=17 preserves cardinality and representation equivalence
PASS  N=32 preserves cardinality and representation equivalence
PASS  N=1 preserves its sole requested raw components
```

No tested cardinality required a custom tone-scale container.

### F.5 Extended finite raw values

Representative raw values included lightness outside `[0, 1]`, negative
chroma, large positive chroma and negative/multi-turn hue.

Observed:

```text
PASS  extended finite lightness values are preserved exactly
PASS  extended finite chroma values are preserved exactly
PASS  raw lightness is not implicitly clamped
PASS  negative chroma is not implicitly clamped
PASS  large positive chroma remains raw
PASS  negative and multi-turn hue values are stored without normalization
```

Therefore the low-level tone operations remain mathematical/raw operations.

They do not silently apply UI-domain restrictions.

### F.6 Component independence

Observed:

```text
PASS  withLightness changes only raw lightness
PASS  withChroma changes only raw chroma
PASS  withHue changes only stored raw hue
PASS  hue schedule does not alter stored lightness or chroma
PASS  varying chroma does not alter requested raw lightness
PASS  chroma/lightness composition leaves stored hue unchanged
```

The scalar decomposition established in earlier phases therefore remains valid
under extended finite values.

### F.7 Powerless hue

Observed:

```text
PASS  zero chroma preserves stored powerless hue
PASS  restoring chroma preserves the stored powerless hue
```

The property also remained valid for selected non-finite hue values:

```text
PASS  zero chroma and chroma restoration preserve stored NaN hue
PASS  zero chroma and chroma restoration preserve stored infinite hue signs
```

Therefore zero chroma does not erase or synthesize stored hue information.

### F.8 Explicit finite monotonicity

Observed:

```text
PASS  ascending explicit lightness remains nondecreasing
PASS  descending explicit lightness remains nonincreasing
PASS  constant explicit lightness remains constant
```

Because raw tone composition stores requested lightness values, chroma/hue
composition does not disturb these ordering properties.

### F.9 Generated finite schedule composition

R0.11-B already established the arithmetic semantics of finite generated
schedules.

R0.11-F verifies only the cross-phase composition property.

Observed:

```text
PASS  generated finite ascending schedule remains monotone after tone composition
PASS  generated finite descending schedule remains monotone after tone composition
```

No new generated-schedule algorithm was required.

### F.10 Raw anchor behavior

Observed:

```text
PASS  matching raw seed anchor remains exact
PASS  mismatching raw schedule preserves requested value instead of seed
```

This confirms the existing distinction:

```text
matching raw schedule
    -> seed may remain exact naturally

mismatching raw schedule
    -> ordinary raw schedule remains authoritative
```

No hidden anchor repair or nearest-anchor policy was introduced.

### F.11 NaN lightness

Observed for both `float` and `double`:

```text
PASS  NaN lightness remains NaN and leaves other raw components unchanged
```

The raw primitive therefore does not silently replace, clamp or repair NaN
lightness.

### F.12 Infinite lightness

Observed:

```text
PASS  positive and negative infinite lightness preserve classification and sign
```

The raw primitive preserves both infinity classification and sign.

### F.13 NaN chroma

Observed:

```text
PASS  NaN chroma remains NaN and leaves other raw components unchanged
```

No implicit chroma canonicalization occurs.

### F.14 Infinite chroma

Observed:

```text
PASS  positive and negative infinite chroma preserve classification and sign
```

This remains a raw representation property.

It is not a claim that such a value is suitable for gamut mapping.

### F.15 NaN hue

Observed:

```text
PASS  NaN hue remains NaN and leaves other raw components unchanged
```

No canonical hue is synthesized.

### F.16 Infinite hue

Observed:

```text
PASS  positive and negative infinite hue preserve classification and sign
```

The raw hue representation therefore remains non-normalizing even for
infinite values.

### F.17 Non-finite comparison semantics

NaN-containing tones cannot be meaningfully tested through ordinary whole-value
equality because:

```text
NaN != NaN
```

R0.11-F therefore compares:

```text
NaN by classification
infinity by classification and sign
ordinary values by exact equality
```

This was sufficient for the property experiment.

No general-purpose "invalid color" abstraction was required.

### F.18 Representation equivalence with non-finite values

Observed:

```text
PASS  static-array and caller-output preserve equivalent non-finite classifications
PASS  non-finite raw components do not alter family cardinality
PASS  explicit mixed non-finite schedules preserve classification and infinity sign
```

Therefore the representation choice does not alter raw non-finite semantics.

### F.19 Runtime and CTFE — non-finite values

Observed:

```text
PASS  runtime and CTFE agree on selected float non-finite raw properties
PASS  runtime and CTFE agree on selected double non-finite raw properties
```

The corresponding compile-time property probes also compiled successfully in
all four final matrix configurations.

Therefore the ordinary raw component operations remain CTFE-capable for the
tested NaN and infinity cases.

### F.20 Runtime and CTFE — finite edge properties

Observed for both scalar types:

```text
PASS  runtime and CTFE agree on representative finite raw edge properties
```

No CTFE-specific tone-generation API is required.

### F.21 Explicit gamut boundary

R0.11-F does not reopen gamut-mapper research.

It reuses the already validated R0.11-D composition and checks only the
structural integration property.

Observed:

```text
PASS  finite raw family remains authoritative while mapped target results stay separate
```

Therefore:

```text
raw Oklch family
    remains unchanged and authoritative

explicit mapper
    produces a separate target-space result
```

The mapped output may be in target gamut without rewriting the raw family.

### F.22 Non-finite gamut behavior remains out of scope

R0.11-F deliberately does not pass NaN or infinity through the gamut mappers.

Therefore R0.11 does not establish:

```text
NaN gamut-mapping semantics
infinite gamut-mapping semantics
```

Those values were tested only at the raw tone/component layer.

### F.23 No universal numerical epsilon

The phase-F properties were primarily structural:

```text
exact component preservation
classification
sign
cardinality
ordering
representation equivalence
raw-versus-mapped separation
```

No universal epsilon was required.

R0.11 therefore provides no evidence for adding one.

Library-wide numerical-tolerance policy remains a separate research concern.

### F.24 No new container abstraction

The edge/property tests did not expose a contradiction in the phase-E
representation model.

The validated model remains:

```text
compile-time-known cardinality
    -> Oklch!T[N]

runtime-known cardinality
    -> caller-owned Oklch!T[]
```

No custom tone-scale container was required.

### F.25 No new gamut abstraction

The property phase did not expose a need for:

```text
a new gamut mapper
an implicit mapper
a default mapper
a tone-scale-specific gamut container
```

The existing explicit mapping composition remains sufficient.

### F.26 No generated non-finite schedule contract

R0.11-F deliberately avoids promoting arithmetic involving:

```text
Inf - Inf
0 * Inf
NaN interpolation
```

into generated-schedule API semantics.

The R0.11-B generated-schedule contract remains a finite-endpoint contract.

Non-finite semantics are established only for explicit/raw component
operations.

### F.27 Compiler qualification issue discovered during F-B

The initial F-B classification helper shape deduced:

```text
const(float)
const(double)
```

from const component values.

The scalar constraint intentionally accepts the unqualified scalar type.

The research helper was corrected from:

```d
bool helper(T)(T value)
```

to the const-correct form:

```d
bool helper(T)(const(T) value)
```

so template deduction retains:

```text
T = float
T = double
```

This was a test-helper qualification issue, not a NaN/infinity semantic
failure.

After the correction the complete F-B runtime and CTFE probes passed.

### F.28 R0.8 fixture namespace boundary

During F-C, UFCS-style access to the R0.8 fixture's gamut predicate was not
available for fixture-owned `LinearSRgb` values.

The correct module-qualified form is:

```d
gamut.inSrgbGamut(value)
```

This preserves the deliberate separation between the R0.11 and extracted R0.8
type worlds.

This was an adapter/namespace issue, not a gamut-semantic failure.

### F.29 Phase-F conclusions

R0.11-F validates the following property conclusions:

1. Representative tone-family cardinalities preserve exact cardinality.
2. Explicit finite components remain raw.
3. Extended lightness is not implicitly clamped.
4. Negative chroma is not implicitly canonicalized.
5. Hue is not implicitly normalized.
6. Powerless hue remains stored data.
7. NaN component values are not silently repaired.
8. Positive and negative infinity retain classification and sign.
9. Component replacement leaves unrelated components unchanged.
10. Explicit finite lightness ordering is preserved.
11. Generated finite schedule ordering survives tone composition.
12. Matching raw anchors remain exact.
13. Mismatching raw schedules remain authoritative.
14. Static-array and caller-output representations preserve the same tested
    edge semantics.
15. Runtime and CTFE agree on representative finite properties.
16. Runtime and CTFE agree on selected NaN/infinity raw properties.
17. Explicit gamut mapping remains separate from the raw tone family.
18. No universal epsilon is required by the tested properties.
19. No custom tone-scale container is required.
20. No new gamut abstraction is required.
21. Non-finite generated-schedule semantics remain deliberately unspecified.

### F.30 R0.11 conclusion

R0.11 has now validated:

```text
A  primitive decomposition
B  schedule semantics
C  chroma and hue policy
D  explicit gamut composition
E  representation and CTFE
F  properties and edge cases
```

The combined evidence supports a low-level tone-scale model built from:

```text
explicit raw Oklch component operations
explicit finite schedule generation
explicit gamut mapping
static arrays when cardinality is known at compile time
caller-owned slices when cardinality is known only at runtime
ordinary functions usable at runtime and CTFE
```

The research did not justify:

```text
implicit gamut mapping
implicit clamping
implicit chroma canonicalization
implicit hue normalization
a custom tone-scale container
a universal numerical epsilon
a CTFE-specific API family
```

R0.11 is complete.

Public production API names remain provisional until promotion and consumer
validation.
