# R0.13-C — Property characterization

**Status:** EXPERIMENT
**Parent:** R0.13 — Numerical tolerance and reference policy
**Document revision:** 1.1
**Date:** 2026-09-25
**GitHub:** #9

This harness characterizes the R0.13-C operation families without selecting a
universal epsilon or freezing production acceptance thresholds.

Implemented blocks:

```text
C1 — Oklab <-> OKLCH / hue
C2 — alpha / premultiplication / source-over
C3 — interpolation / hue paths / alpha-aware interpolation
C4 — WCAG 2 relative luminance / contrast
C5 — deltaEOK
```

C1-C5 now cover the planned R0.13-C operation families.

## C1 questions

C1 separates:

```text
EXACT
    exact-achromatic semantics
    direct component preservation where algebraically guaranteed

REFERENCE
    chroma magnitude
    non-achromatic hue
    polar -> Cartesian coordinates

DERIVED
    Cartesian -> polar -> Cartesian round trip

RANGE
    large finite Cartesian coordinates
    normal and subnormal tiny Cartesian coordinates

POLICY
    near-achromatic classification remains outside this numerical comparator
```

Diagnostics record absolute, relative and ULP differences where those metrics
are meaningful. Hue additionally uses circular angular error so equivalent
angles near the 0/360-degree seam are not treated as hundreds of degrees apart.

No diagnostic quantity is itself an acceptance threshold.

## 2D `hypot` compatibility

R0.5 used:

```text
sqrt(a*a + b*b)
```

for OKLCH chroma. That source form can overflow or underflow in intermediates
for finite inputs.

The natural replacement is two-argument `hypot(a, b)`, but the supported
frontend/Phobos 2.111 baseline has a known tiny-operand correctness defect in
that overload.

C1 therefore copies the narrow compatibility strategy validated by
`euclid-core-d` issue #4 and merged in commit:

```text
c9fd4b2f5eca46a4d0170b0de915b8e1481380a9
```

The copied research-local helper:

- applies the workaround only when `__VERSION__ == 2111`;
- intercepts the affected negligible-component case with an underflow-safe
  magnitude-ratio comparison;
- delegates directly to Phobos `hypot` from frontend 2.112 onward;
- preserves the euclid-core-d special-value ordering used by the validated
  helper.

`color-d` does **not** take a dependency on `euclid-core-d` for this experiment.
The code is copied because the numerical compatibility rule is applicable, not
because geometry Core is a color-library dependency.

The helper remains research infrastructure until R0.13/R1 decides the final
production ownership and spelling.

## Reference path

C1 does not use the copied `hypot` compatibility helper as its own numerical
oracle.

The reference chroma path uses a separately implemented scaled two-dimensional
norm evaluated in D `real`. This avoids the legacy squared-sum overflow/
underflow mechanism and keeps the candidate and reference mechanisms distinct.

Angle and inverse-transform references are also evaluated in `real`.

D `real` is only a local higher-precision diagnostic when it is wider than
`double`; it is not portable arbitrary precision and is not treated as ground
truth.

## C1 observed results

C1 has been run in debug builds on the current x86_64 Linux research host with:

- DMD 2.111.0;
- LDC 1.41.0 using DMD frontend 2.111.0 and LLVM 19.1.7.

These runs are exploratory R0.13-C evidence. They do not replace the controlled
runtime/CTFE, Debug/Release or compiler-version portability matrix assigned to
R0.13-E.

### Exact and axis observations

For both scalar types and both tested compilers, exact achromatic input
`a == 0 && b == 0` preserved `L` and produced exact `C == 0` and `h == 0`.
The selected positive/negative a/b axis probes also produced the expected
0/90/180/270-degree directions without observed error.

These are candidate exact-contract observations. C1 does not generalize them to
arbitrary non-axis conversion results.

### Chroma range finding

The legacy R0.5 chroma expression `sqrt(a*a + b*b)` failed the declared finite
extended-domain goal in both `float` and `double`:

- a large finite pair overflowed to infinity;
- the smallest positive subnormal on one axis underflowed to zero.

The compatibility `metricHypot` candidate preserved a finite large-pair result
and preserved the smallest positive subnormal exactly. For a pair of smallest
subnormals, the wider-`real` mathematical reference lies between target-type
values but correctly rounds back to the smallest target-type subnormal.

This is evidence against the legacy squared-sum source form. It supports the
frontend-2.111-compatible two-argument `hypot` route as the current production
direction, without freezing a public helper name or tolerance.

### Ordinary and extended numerical observations

For the selected ordinary and extended probes, direct chroma/hue reference
errors and Cartesian round-trip errors remained at ordinary floating-point
scale. The observed double round-trip envelope reached 3 ULP in the selected
extended case.

The current DMD and LDC debug outputs were identical for all `float` rows and
for all critical range rows. Three ordinary `double` rows differed:

- ordinary chroma: DMD landed on the target-type-rounded wider reference while
  LDC was 1 ULP away;
- ordinary round-trip `a`: DMD was 1 ULP from the original value while LDC was
  exact;
- ordinary round-trip `b`: DMD was 1 ULP from the original value while LDC was
  exact.

This is useful evidence that a smaller direct-reference error does not imply a
smaller composed round-trip error. `REFERENCE` and `DERIVED` envelopes must
therefore remain distinct.

### Diagnostic interpretation

The ULP diagnostic compares the observed target-type value with the wider
`real` reference rounded to that target type. Output therefore uses the label
`ulp_to_rounded_ref`.

Consequently, non-zero absolute or relative error against the wider reference
can coexist with `ulp_to_rounded_ref=0`. This is expected when the observed
`float` or `double` is the correctly rounded target-type value.

No C1 observation is promoted to a production tolerance constant at this
stage.

## C2 questions

C2 carries the validated R0.6 alpha architecture into the R0.13 comparison
taxonomy. It keeps straight alpha and premultiplied linear-light sRGB distinct
and characterizes only the numerical properties needed by that architecture.

```text
EXACT
    alpha == 1 premultiplication on selected finite values
    explicit alpha == 0 unpremultiplication branch
    zero-alpha hidden-color collapse on selected finite positive colors
    canonical transparent-source identity
    selected finite opaque-source identity
    canonical transparent-destination identity

CLASSIFY
    alpha validity in [0, 1]
    rejection of finite out-of-range values, NaN and infinity

REFERENCE
    premultiply in wider real arithmetic
    unpremultiply in wider real arithmetic
    premultiplied Porter-Duff source-over in wider real arithmetic

DERIVED
    straight -> premultiplied -> straight round trip
    source-over associativity, left grouping versus right grouping

RANGE
    smallest-positive-subnormal alpha
    target-type underflow during premultiplication
    information loss after unpremultiplication
```

The exact identity probes are deliberately scoped to selected finite values and
canonical transparent premultiplied black where required. C2 does not claim a
bitwise signed-zero contract.

### C2 reference path

The C2 reference functions evaluate the same defining alpha/compositing
equations in D `real` after widening the target-type inputs.

This is a **wider-arithmetic reference**, not an independent formula oracle.
Its purpose is to separate ordinary target-type rounding from semantic and
range failures.

For `sourceOver`, the reference starts from the already-premultiplied
target-type inputs. That isolates the arithmetic of the low-level compositing
primitive from any rounding introduced by the preceding premultiplication.

As in C1, `real` is local diagnostic evidence only when it is wider than
`double`.

### Tiny-alpha range probe

R0.6 established the intentional non-injectivity of premultiplication at
exactly zero alpha. C2 also probes the smallest positive subnormal alpha.

The selected straight channels are:

```text
(0.5, 1.0, -0.5)
```

At that alpha, multiplication of the half-magnitude channels can round to zero
even though alpha itself is non-zero and valid. The following
unpremultiplication can therefore no longer reconstruct those original
channels.

The DMD and LDC runs both observed this loss. The half-magnitude channels
rounded to signed zero during premultiplication, while the unit channel
preserved the smallest positive subnormal. Unpremultiplication therefore
returned `(0, 1, -0)` instead of `(0.5, 1, -0.5)`.

This is a representational range limit, not ordinary round-trip noise and not a
reason to enlarge a generic tolerance. In particular, straight ->
premultiplied -> straight is not universally lossless even when alpha is
positive and valid.

### C2 observed results

C2 has been run in debug builds on the same x86_64 Linux research host with:

- DMD 2.111.0;
- LDC 1.41.0 using DMD frontend 2.111.0 and LLVM 19.1.7.

After excluding compiler/build banners and the preceding C1 output, all 99 C2
output lines from the two runs were byte-identical.

For both scalar types and both tested compilers:

- the selected exact premultiplication, zero-alpha, hidden-color-collapse and
  source-over identity probes all held exactly;
- alpha classification accepted 0, 0.5 and 1 and rejected negative values,
  values above 1, NaN and infinity;
- ordinary premultiplication and unpremultiplication matched the target-type
  rounded wider-arithmetic reference exactly in the selected probes;
- the selected ordinary and extended premultiply -> unpremultiply round trips
  were exact in target type;
- extended-range source-over remained unclipped and differed from the wider
  reference by at most 1 ULP in the selected probes;
- source-over associativity was not bitwise exact: the selected float case
  differed by 1 ULP in one channel, and the selected double case differed by
  1 ULP in one channel and alpha;
- the smallest-positive-subnormal-alpha probe demonstrated deterministic
  target-type information loss before unpremultiplication.

The associativity observation belongs to `DERIVED`, not `EXACT`. The
tiny-alpha observation belongs to `RANGE`, not to a tolerance envelope.

The identical DMD/LDC C2 debug output is useful cross-compiler evidence but is
not promoted to a general portability guarantee. Controlled Debug/Release,
runtime/CTFE and compiler-version comparisons remain R0.13-E work.

No C2 observation freezes a production tolerance or public API.


## C3 questions

C3 carries the validated R0.7 interpolation semantics into the R0.13
comparison taxonomy. It deliberately separates semantic endpoint behavior from
the numerical properties of the scalar interpolation formula.

```text
EXACT
    selected dyadic scalar endpoints
    deterministic hue-path branch decisions
    exact 180-degree hue tie behavior
    exact C == 0 hue borrowing
    negative-chroma canonicalization on selected equivalent inputs
    alpha-aware hidden-color behavior on selected canonical inputs
    zero-alpha no-division structure

REFERENCE
    ordinary scalar interpolation against wider real arithmetic
    extrapolation against wider real arithmetic
    non-trivial hue interpolation after semantic endpoint adjustment

DERIVED
    alpha-aware rectangular interpolation after interpolation premultiplication
    polar interpolation after chroma canonicalization and hue adjustment

POLICY
    near-achromatic values remain distinct from exact C == 0
    no hidden chroma epsilon is introduced

RANGE
    finite opposite-sign endpoints near +/-T.max
    subtraction overflow in a + (b - a) * t
    endpoint failures caused by evaluating b - a before t is applied
```

### Legacy scalar form

R0.7 uses:

```text
a + (b - a) * t
```

This form has attractive ordinary behavior and preserves extrapolation, but it
does not provide a universal finite-input endpoint guarantee. If finite `a`
and `b` are far enough apart, `b - a` can overflow before multiplication by
`t`.

C3 therefore keeps two functions distinct:

- `legacyLerp`, which reproduces the R0.7 source form exactly;
- `endpointAwareLerp`, which adds only explicit `t == 0` and `t == 1`
  branches before delegating all other cases to the legacy form.

The endpoint-aware helper is a research probe, not a complete robust
interpolation algorithm. In particular, it intentionally does not claim to
solve interior overflow or extrapolation-range questions.

### Endpoint semantics versus numerical range

If the project wants `t == 0` and `t == 1` to be exact semantic contracts,
those contracts should be implemented structurally. A tolerance cannot repair
a NaN or infinity produced before the endpoint multiplier becomes effective.

Conversely, exact endpoint branches do not define the acceptable numerical
envelope for interior interpolation. C3 reports those categories separately.

### Hue and achromatic policy

C3 retains the R0.7 hue rules:

- `shorter`, `longer`, `increasing` and `decreasing` remain explicit;
- exact +/-180-degree ties are deterministic;
- exact `C == 0` may borrow the chromatic endpoint hue;
- near-achromatic non-zero chroma does not implicitly borrow hue;
- negative chroma is canonicalized before polar interpolation.

These are semantic or policy decisions, not floating-point tolerance results.

### C3 reference path

Scalar references widen the target-type inputs to D `real` before evaluating
the same interpolation equation. Hue references first apply the same semantic
hue-path endpoint selection, then evaluate the scalar interpolation in wider
arithmetic.

This is a wider-arithmetic reference, not an independent interpolation
specification oracle. As in C1 and C2, `real` remains local diagnostic
evidence rather than portable ground truth.

### C3 observed results

C3 has been run in debug builds on the same x86_64 Linux research host with:

- DMD 2.111.0;
- LDC 1.41.0 using DMD frontend 2.111.0 and LLVM 19.1.7.

After excluding compiler/build banners and the preceding C1/C2 output, all 57
C3 output lines from the two runs were byte-identical.

For both scalar types and both tested compilers:

- the selected ordinary endpoint, hue-path, 180-degree-tie, equal-normalized-hue,
  exact-achromatic-borrowing, negative-chroma-canonicalization and alpha
  structural probes all produced the expected exact decisions;
- the near-achromatic non-zero chroma probe remained distinct from exact
  achromatic borrowing, confirming that this remains an explicit policy
  boundary rather than an implicit epsilon rule;
- ordinary scalar interpolation differed from the wider-arithmetic reference
  by 1 ULP in the selected float and double probes;
- the selected scalar extrapolation and hue reference probes rounded to the
  same target-type values as the wider reference;
- selected derived OKLCH interpolation differed by at most 1 ULP for float and
  rounded to the same target-type values for double;
- selected alpha-aware rectangular interpolation differed by at most 1 ULP for
  float and by at most 2 ULP for double.

The range probe exposed a structural failure of the legacy scalar form
`a + (b - a) * t` for finite opposite-sign endpoints `-T.max` and `T.max`:

- at `t == 0`, the legacy expression produced NaN instead of `a`;
- at `t == 1`, it produced positive infinity instead of `b`;
- at `t == 0.5`, it produced positive infinity instead of the finite
  mathematical midpoint zero.

The failure occurs because `b - a` overflows before multiplication by `t`.
It is therefore a range/algorithm issue, not an approximate-comparison issue.

The research-local `endpointAwareLerp` restored the two endpoint identities
exactly by handling `t == 0` and `t == 1` before evaluating the legacy form.
It deliberately did not claim to solve the interior-overflow case.

This yields two distinct R1 design questions:

1. whether exact endpoint semantics should be guaranteed structurally;
2. whether production interpolation must remain finite whenever the
   mathematical interpolation of finite endpoints is finite.

Those questions must not be collapsed into one numerical tolerance.

The identical DMD/LDC C3 debug output is useful cross-compiler evidence but is
not a general portability guarantee. Controlled Debug/Release, runtime/CTFE
and compiler-version comparisons remain R0.13-E work.

No C3 observation freezes a production tolerance, public interpolation spelling
or complete robust-lerp algorithm.


## C4 questions

C4 carries the validated R0.9 WCAG-2 luminance/contrast semantics into the
R0.13 comparison taxonomy.

```text
CLASSIFY
    finite encoded/linear sRGB components
    all components in [0, 1]

EXACT
    linear black luminance == 0
    linear white luminance == 1 on the selected published coefficients
    selected same-color contrast == 1
    contrast symmetry on selected valid inputs

REFERENCE
    normative black/white contrast value 21:1
    encoded-sRGB decode in wider real arithmetic
    WCAG relative luminance in wider real arithmetic
    contrast ratio in wider real arithmetic
    primary coefficients as published WCAG values

BOUNDARY
    nextDown / at / nextUp around encoded 0.04045
    reuse the R0.13-B transfer characterization rather than inventing a new
    transfer tolerance

DISTINCT
    WCAG relative luminance is not XYZ-D65 Y

REGRESSION
    the old R0.9 "independent direct WCAG reference path" is same-formula
    regression evidence, not an independent numerical oracle
```

### Exactness correction from the first C4 compile

The first DMD 2.111 compile rejected an exact CTFE assertion that the
black/white contrast result was bitwise equal to `21.0`, even though the
compiler diagnostic printed both operands as `21.0`.

That is precisely the distinction R0.13 is intended to expose: a normative
mathematical/reference value of 21:1 does not by itself justify an `EXACT`
floating-point comparison. C4 therefore keeps same-color ratio 1 and selected
symmetry in the exact bucket, but moves black/white 21:1 to `REFERENCE` and
reports its numerical distance explicitly.

No tolerance was introduced to make the compile-time assertion pass.

### Reference provenance

WCAG relative luminance is a standards-defined computation. C4 therefore
distinguishes the normative formula from numerical independence.

The wider-arithmetic C4 reference widens the target-type input to D `real`
before applying the WCAG sRGB decode and the published weights
`0.2126/0.7152/0.0722`. This is useful for characterizing target-type rounding,
but it is still the same defining formula.

R0.9 also contained a separately spelled "direct WCAG reference" implementation.
Because that route used the same transfer constants, branch and published
weights, C4 reclassifies it as same-formula regression evidence. Exact agreement
between those two spellings cannot establish an independent tolerance envelope.

### Transfer boundary

C4 does not reopen R0.13-B1. The encoded threshold probes use
`nextDown(0.04045)`, target-type `0.04045`, and `nextUp(0.04045)` so WCAG
luminance can be observed across the same rounded sRGB decode boundary.

The B1 finding remains authoritative for the transfer primitive itself:
ordinary floating-point drift and the rounded-threshold structural behavior
must not be collapsed into one generic epsilon.

### WCAG versus XYZ Y

The WCAG published luminance coefficients remain intentionally distinct from
the more precise linear-sRGB -> XYZ-D65 matrix used elsewhere in color-d.
C4 reports that difference as a semantic distinction, not as an error against
one preferred value.

### Domain and alpha boundary

The standards-facing measurement domain remains finite sRGB or linear-sRGB
components in `[0, 1]`. Extended color-d values are valid color mathematics
but are not valid WCAG measurements.

Unresolved alpha remains outside the ordinary WCAG measurement primitive.
Compositing/alpha semantics were characterized in C2; C4 assumes the color to
be measured has already been resolved.

### C4 observed results

C4 has been run in debug builds on the same x86_64 Linux research host with:

- DMD 2.111.0;
- LDC 1.41.0 using DMD frontend 2.111.0 and LLVM 19.1.7.

After excluding compiler/build banners and the preceding C1-C3 output, the C4
runtime output from the two runs was byte-identical.

For both scalar types and both tested compilers:

- domain classification accepted the selected finite encoded/linear values in
  [0,1] and rejected below-range, above-range, NaN and infinity probes;
- selected linear black and white luminance identities held exactly;
- selected same-color contrast and contrast symmetry held exactly;
- the old R0.9 separately spelled WCAG route remained exactly equal to the
  candidate route, confirming its classification as same-formula regression
  rather than an independent oracle;
- WCAG relative luminance remained observably distinct from XYZ-D65 Y by about
  1.60212e-05 for the selected ordinary encoded color.

The selected black/white contrast result illustrates why the normative 21:1
value belongs to `REFERENCE`, not universally to `EXACT`:

- `float` produced about 20.99999809, one ULP from target-rounded 21;
- `double` produced exact 21 at runtime on both tested compilers.

Ordinary encoded WCAG probes reached 1 ULP for float and 4 ULP for double in
the selected cases. The selected ordinary contrast probe reached 3 ULP for
float and 2 ULP for double. These are observations, not promoted thresholds.

The encoded transfer-boundary luminance probes showed the same selected
ULP-to-rounded-reference pattern for both scalar types:

```text
below   0 ULP
at      1 ULP
above   3 ULP
```

This is downstream evidence of the already-characterized R0.13-B1 transfer
boundary. It does not justify a separate or larger generic WCAG tolerance.

### CTFE/runtime follow-up

Before black/white 21:1 was reclassified from `EXACT` to `REFERENCE`, DMD
2.111 rejected a compile-time assertion equivalent to:

```d
static assert(ctfeContrast == 21.0);
```

even though the later DMD runtime probe of the same `double` computation
reported exact 21 with zero ULP distance to the wider reference.

That observation is retained as concrete motivation for R0.13-E
runtime-versus-CTFE characterization. C4 does not infer its mechanism and does
not turn it into a WCAG tolerance rule.

The identical DMD/LDC C4 runtime output is useful cross-compiler evidence but
is not a general portability guarantee. Controlled Debug/Release,
runtime/CTFE and compiler-version comparisons remain R0.13-E work.

No C4 observation freezes a production tolerance or final public WCAG API.


## C5 questions

C5 carries the validated R0.10 `deltaEOK` semantics into the R0.13 comparison
taxonomy without inheriting R0.10's provisional `1e-12`, `2e-5` or
`8 * epsilon` acceptance bounds.

```text
EXACT
    identity distance == 0
    selected one-axis distances
    analytical 3-4-12 distance == 13
    selected finite symmetry

CLASSIFY
    NaN delta -> NaN
    finite/infinite delta without NaN -> +Inf
    NaN takes precedence over infinity

REFERENCE
    ordinary Oklab distance against wider real scaled norm
    extended finite distance against wider real scaled norm

DERIVED
    deterministic 4096-sample identity/non-negativity/symmetry observations
    deterministic 4096-sample wider-reference ULP/absolute-error maxima
    deterministic 4096-sample triangle-inequality positive-slack observations

RANGE
    direct sqrt(dL*dL + da*da + db*db) overflow
    direct squared-sum underflow
    guarded three-argument hypot finite-range behavior
    normal, minimum-normal and smallest-subnormal one-axis probes

POLICY
    no JND threshold
    no hidden color-space conversion
    no clipping, gamut mapping or alpha resolution
```

### Candidate and reference

The C5 candidate is the R0.10 preferred direction:

1. form the three same-type Oklab component differences;
2. return NaN if any difference is NaN;
3. otherwise return positive infinity if any difference is infinite;
4. otherwise delegate the finite Euclidean norm to Phobos three-argument
   `hypot`.

The reference is a separately implemented scaled three-dimensional norm in D
`real`. Scaling avoids the direct squared-sum overflow/underflow mechanism.
As elsewhere in R0.13, `real` is local wider-precision evidence when it is
wider than `double`, not portable arbitrary precision.

### Property characterization without a provisional epsilon

R0.10 used operation-local tolerances to turn generated properties into
pass/fail tests. C5 deliberately removes those thresholds.

For 4096 deterministic generated triples per scalar type, C5 instead records:

- any exact identity failures;
- any negative distances;
- any non-zero symmetry differences;
- the maximum absolute and ULP distance to the wider reference;
- the count and maximum magnitude of positive floating-point triangle slack.

These measurements can inform later policy, but their maxima are not
automatically promoted to production tolerances.

### Range versus tolerance

The direct squared-sum implementation remains a range diagnostic only. An
overflow to infinity or an underflow to zero for a mathematically representable
finite norm is an algorithm/range failure and must not be accepted by widening
a comparison tolerance.

C5 also extends the R0.10 one-axis range observation from `T.min_normal` to
the smallest positive subnormal. This is observational: the harness does not
assume beforehand that every compiler/build will produce the same result.

### Special values

Raw three-argument Phobos `hypot` special-value behavior is not used as the
public semantic contract. C5 retains R0.10's explicit guard order so NaN takes
precedence over infinity. The raw result is reported only as diagnostic
evidence where useful.

### C5 observed results

C5 has been run in debug builds on the same x86_64 Linux research host with:

- DMD 2.111.0;
- LDC 1.41.0 using DMD frontend 2.111.0 and LLVM 19.1.7.

The C5 outputs were identical except for the two generated-property
`reference_max_abs` values. All analytical, special-value, ordinary/extended
reference, range, ULP-maximum, symmetry and triangle-slack observations matched.

For both scalar types and both tested compilers:

- selected identity, one-axis, 3-4-12 and finite symmetry cases held exactly;
- the explicit special-value policy held: NaN propagated, +/-infinity mapped to
  positive infinity, and NaN took precedence over infinity;
- raw three-argument Phobos `hypot` did not itself provide that policy on the
  tested toolchains, confirming the need for explicit guards;
- selected ordinary and extended reference probes rounded to the same target
  values as the wider `real` scaled-norm reference;
- the direct squared-sum implementation overflowed to infinity for the selected
  large finite one-axis input;
- the direct squared-sum implementation underflowed to zero for both
  `T.min_normal` and the smallest positive subnormal one-axis inputs;
- the guarded-`hypot` candidate preserved all three selected one-axis values
  exactly, including the smallest positive subnormal;
- 4096 deterministic generated cases produced zero identity failures, zero
  negative distances, zero non-zero symmetry deltas and zero positive triangle
  slack;
- the largest ULP distance to the target-rounded wider reference was 2 for both
  float and double.

The only DMD/LDC C5 runtime differences were the maximum absolute reference
error found by the deterministic generated sample:

```text
                         DMD              LDC
float reference_max_abs  1.018749e-06     1.431924e-06
double reference_max_abs 2.143251e-15     2.190088e-15
```

The float maximum differs by about 1.41x and the double maximum by about 1.02x,
while both compiler runs still share the same maximum ULP distance of 2. This
is further evidence that absolute-error maxima and ULP maxima answer different
questions and should not be collapsed into one generic tolerance.

The generated maxima remain observations, not acceptance thresholds. In
particular, C5 does not promote 2 ULP, either absolute-error maximum, or the old
R0.10 epsilon-scaled bounds into production policy.

The identical range and special-value behavior across these two debug runs is
useful cross-compiler evidence but is not a portability guarantee. Controlled
Debug/Release, runtime/CTFE and compiler-version comparisons remain R0.13-E
work.

No C5 observation freezes a numerical tolerance, JND policy or public
`deltaEOK` API.

## Characterization rule

The harness is observational first.

A legacy implementation producing overflow, underflow or a desired-contract
mismatch is a research result, not a reason to widen a generic tolerance.
Likewise, the maximum observed error is not automatically promoted into a test
threshold.
